      <p><b>First Prize Winner: Nicosia Light Festival, by Jannis Sidiropoulos, which received gifts worth 3,000 euros.</b></p>
<p>The inspiration behind this idea was that having worked with light for over 20 years, Jannis wanted to share the joy it brings to people. He is inspired by many light and visual artists worldwide and the possibilities the open canvas of out-of-the-ordinary canvas of cultural sites gives. Janniâ€™s business idea for a light art festival promoting local and international talent while educating about the local culture and entertaining at the same time. To build his concept, he used the Business Model Canvas methodology. The next step for this idea is to approach the authorities and partner with various organizations to start the production process.</p>
