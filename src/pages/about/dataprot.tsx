        <h2>M. Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an identifier
          (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a
          web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent
          back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the
          server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session”
          cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will
          remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user
          before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will
          expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
          Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally
          identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you
          may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
