## Notes on video art created for ReInHerit in Performance: The Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios Mansion, by visual artist Stefanos Papadas

During the performances, two main videos were created. A first longer video (40-minutes) was projected throughout the performance on wall of adjacent building facing the courtyard of the mansion:

A shorter video (6-minutes loop) was projected in a small room at the ground floor of the mansion – storage space / old servants’ quarters:

 The following section describes the creation process of this video art:

**\- Step 1 - Video Concept.** 

Since the purpose of the project was to give new "life" to the museum, the video through projection mapping was designed to represent H.K. Mansion’s “breath” in a symbolic and abstract way. The different rooms and spaces were identified with the vital organs of a living organism. In this way, the viewer had a visual stimulus that completed his/her immersive experience. 

At first, it was needed to create an extensive visual collection of the museum’s data. We organized a professional photographic recording to be done on two separate days and we collected the following data:

* Architecture (external and internal space)
* Perspectives and Details
* Vegetation/Nature in relation to the museum
* Objects
* Relationship between light and building (external and internal)
* Materials
* Textures
* Patterns
* Combined images of the above

**\- Step 2 - Study/Image Selection**

At this stage, all the photographic material was studied. The most interesting images were distinguished and placed in separate folders.

**\- Step 3 - Visual Narration - Visual Structure**

Beginning - Middle - End: 10 chapters as 10 different parts-locations-rooms of the building

**\- Step 4 - Cut out interesting elements**  

**\- Step 5 - Material experimentation and animation**  

**\- Step 6 - Creation of 10 different visual & moving chapters**  

**\- Step 7 - Video Editing/Rhythm**  

**\- Step 8 - Color Grade and Color correction**  

**\- Step 9 - Final export**  

**\- Step 10 - Projection Mapping**
