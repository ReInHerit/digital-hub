Remember, remember â€“ and pair the museum items from memory! <br/>
Print out the cards, cut and glue on thin cardboard, on one side only.
Then lay down all the cards, face-up, and take a good look at where each design is.
Then turn the cards upside-down and take turns trying to match the pairs of museum items.
Feeling adventurous?  Add a timer! <br/>
Have fun!
