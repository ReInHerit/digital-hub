Another classic – make your way up to the last square first to win the game.<br/>
Climb as many ladders as you can to get to the finish faster, but beware of the hungry snakes – they will send you back down the game board!<br/>
Print out the game board and glue on carton paper. All you need now is a game piece for each player, and a single die.<br/>
Have fun – and look out for snakes!
