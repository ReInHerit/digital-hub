The classic game of placing the pieces in the right order to form an image. <br/>
Print out the puzzle pieces as a complete image, glue on thin cardboard, and cut into individual puzzle pieces. This could be very therapeutic! <br/>
Then use a second printout – or the puzzle image on a computer screen – as a guide to help you find the adjoining pieces.
This could be very meditative!
