The Digital Hub is organised in three main sections: resources (for cultural heritage professionals), participate and network, "discover" (for all audiences).

The **resources section** offers training material and documentation of the ReInHerit technological outputs, so to enable further reuse and development of the technologies and approaches developed within this project. Â 

The **"participate and networking" section** includes call for participation in events (e.g. Hackathon) and contribution (e.g. to the online collection), as well as a forum for free discussion around topics of relevance for the cultural heritage and cultural tourism sectors.

Finally, in the **"discovery" section**, it is possible to enjoy the products of ReInHerit, such as the digital exhibitions, the videogame, the applications, and the e-Shop.

The following image summarises the content of the Hub and its information architecture.
