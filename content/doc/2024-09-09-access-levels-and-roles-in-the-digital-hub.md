This page offers an overview of the access levels the digital hub provides. There are 5 main roles: viewer, community member, community admin, Digital Hub contributor, Digital Hub administrator.

**Viewer**

The most basic role is the anonymous viewer (with no login / authentication required). A viewer might read content on the Digital Hub, which is all offered with open licenses (Creative Commons licenses). A viewer might view the forum archive, but he/she is not allowed to see current chats and/or to participate in the forum. He/she also cannot add material to the Digital Hub.

**Community member**

A community member is an authenticated user with verified identity, who participates in the forum. Authentication is done via the forum platform (Zulip) based on an email or a social media account. These users can participate in the forum, creating new topics in the rooms and sending private messages to other forum users. The only information publicly available will be the username in the forum and - if the users choses to add one - the profile photo.

**Community admin**

A community admin is an authenticated user with verified identity, who participates in the forum and has admin rights on it. Authentication is done via the forum platform (Zulip) based on an email or a social media account. Additionally to community members, an admin has also the power to remove inappropriate content or disruptive users from the forum and close conversations.

**Digital Hub contributor**

A Digital Hub contributor is a ReInHerit member who contributes directly material to the Digital Hub. The GitHub username of a Hub contributor needs to be added by an Hub Admin to the ReInHerit GitHub team. Subsequently, a Hub contributor has full access to the Digital Hub Content Management System (CMS) and is therefore able to add and edit content. However, he/she cannot delete code repositories, access internal configurations, and directly publish content (publication happens only after a further check by an Hub admin).

**Digital Hub admin**

A Digital Hub admin is a member with full rights within the ReInHerit GitHub organisation. He/she has full control over all functionalities needed for the development of the Digital Hub and the code repositories. The admin team is currently composed by University of Graz members, as the team responsible for the development of the Digital Hub.
