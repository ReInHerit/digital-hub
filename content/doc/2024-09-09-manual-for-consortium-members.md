Here you can download a short manual for Hub contributors (mainly consortium members). This manual will introduce you to the workflow for adding and editing content in the Digital Hub. Remember that you will first need to be authorised by an Hub Administrator, so that your account will be granted editing privileges in the Hub CMS.
