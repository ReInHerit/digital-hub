date: 2025-01-06T18:49:05.241Z
target-audience:
  - PROFESSIONAL
description: This phase will include the development of the applications that
  will be part of a software package that will also include a centralised
  controller software, which will be operated by RISE & UNIFI-MICC and will
  provide server based capabilities for operations that cannot be reliably
  performed on the device, like sending audio and/or video signals to
  loudspeakers/projectors in the performance space, or performing
  computationally intensive tasks like style-transfer.
