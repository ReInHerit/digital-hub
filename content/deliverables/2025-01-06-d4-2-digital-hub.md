title: D4.2 - Digital Hub
date: 2025-01-06T18:52:24.587Z
target-audience:
  - PROFESSIONAL
description: The ReInHerit project will develop a Digital Hub in which the
  toolkits and digital exhibitions can be showcased and made available to the
  public, and where cultural heritage professionals can connect and contribute
  to the project themes. The Digital Hub will therefore host a variety of
  digital content (technical challenge) and will need to satisfy the content and
  accessibility needs of a variety of stakeholders (from academia, cultural
  heritage, and tourism industries). In this sense, the development of the Hub
  will contribute to research on ways to foster meaningful digital collaboration
  between actors in the European cultural sector.
