# About ReInHerit

## Aims and challenges

The Horizon 2020 project "ReInHerit" focuses on current challenges in the heritage sector across Europe (e.g. climate protection and sustainability, digital transformation and digital engagement, integrated experiences across sites and museums) and aims to foster further communication and exchange opportunities between actors of the cultural heritage sector (especially museums, cultural heritage managers and policy experts, tourism industries, heritage audiences, and citizens) by developing solutions, guidelines and tools, which are accessible for everyone.

## Solutions and possibilities

To achieve this goal a sustainable digital ecosystem for cultural heritage - or in other words this Digital Hub - was created. In this hub, all actors of the cultural heritage sector will have a chance to make the future of cultural heritage their own - either by connecting, communicating and sharing with other peers or by getting to know new ways and technologies for cultural heritage management and distribution.
