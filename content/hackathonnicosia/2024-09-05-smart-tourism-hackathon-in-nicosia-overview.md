## ReInHerit SMART TOURISM HACKATHON at the CYENS Center of Excellence

On the weekend of January 20 and 21, the CYENS Center of Excellence hosted the innovative ReInHerit SMART TOURISM HACKATHON at its temporary premises on Dimarchos Lellou Dimitriadis Street, in the center of Nicosia within the walls.

The initiative of the European ReInHerit program, in collaboration with the DiGiNN platform, was a unique opportunity to meet and collaborate with people from programming, design, digital technologies, and cultural heritage.

The event's purpose was to encourage the development of ideas in Smart Tourism in the context of cultural heritage and to promote intercultural understanding, inclusion, and the exploration of new ideas.

In preparation for the competition portion, program mentors delivered introductory webinars to participants, offering guidance in developing ideas, applications, and business planning.
