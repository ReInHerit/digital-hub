**Special Award Winner from the European Cultural Tourism Council: The Archeological Odyssey, by Georgiou Athanasiadis and Daniil Georgiou, received the special award of 1,000 euros.**

In the heart of a bustling city, a small but passionate team of game developers embarked on a beautiful journey to bring history to life by creating the "Archaeological Odyssey." As the team delved into development, challenges arose. Balancing historical accuracy with engaging gameplay proved to be a delicate task. The mobile platform created constraints that required creative solutions. However, each challenge was met with perseverance and a commitment to delivering an exceptional gaming experience. The team marveled at the vibrant landscapes, captivating character designs, and historically accurate images. With a playable prototype in hand, the team entered the testing phase. Mentor feedback was invaluable, leading to numerous iterations that improved the gameplay and user interface.
