![Smart Retrieval](https://ucarecdn.com/dfb81d5a-bcb6-42f4-89c1-58acdf766839/ "Smart Retrieval")

**"Smart Retrieval"**- the advanced **multimedia search tool** that makes it **smart** and **easy** to find the **perfect image!**

This **web application** uses state-of-the-art technology to provide advanced search functions for multimedia archives, including c**ontent-based image retrieval (CBIR)** functions. With Smart Retrieval users can search for images in two ways: using a **text description** or a **combination** of **reference image** and associated **text description.**

What makes Smart Retrieval apart is its state-of-the-art **computer vision** component, which uses a neural network to associate the text describing the desired image content with the image pixels. This allows us to perform conditional image retrieval to search for an image using an **image example** and an **additional textual description** that describes a change from the reference image content.

Smart Retrieval can also be used to perform tagging, or annotation of images, using a zero-shot learning approach. This means that even **small museums or institutions** with limited resources can benefit from our technology without having to collect large amounts of training data.
