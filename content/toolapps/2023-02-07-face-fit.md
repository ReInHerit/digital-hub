**Face-fit** asks the user to replicate an artwork, concentrating on facial expressions that require a much more refined matching. The application invites the users to replicate the pose of the head and the expression of some portraits by famous painters and transfer the face of the user on the artworks, generating a new image. 

The goal of this application is to challenge the user to **analyze** and **replicate** artworks with their own face a obtaining information on the artworks that are replicated and personalized artwork representations that can be shared on social networks.

The innovative application promotes a **user-centred** and **gamification** approach, a process of exploiting game strategies and dynamics in non-game scenarios. It has already been proved to be useful to enhance skills and competences in a variety of domains such as marketing, industry training and entertainment. Also cultural heritage can benefit from a gamification approach which represents an opportunity to **engage visitors** to museums contents through the design of more entertaining, social and challenging digital learning scenarios, to help museums to move from the traditional “look and do not touch” toward a “play and interact” approach.
