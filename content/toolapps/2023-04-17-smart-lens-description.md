This **web application** allows museums visitors to create an interactive visual guide that recognizes the details of artworks. 

Using a variety of **computer vision techniques** such as CBIR, classification, and object detection, users can use their own smartphone or tablet as a lens to inspect and analyze details of interest in any artwork.

This innovative application **provides multimedia information** about the recognized details, making it an **intelligent guide** to any collection or set of artworks you are interested in analyzing. 

Unlike traditional guides that rely on QR codes, Smart Lens requires **active  and visual engagement** from users, making the experience more interactive, engaging and smarter.
