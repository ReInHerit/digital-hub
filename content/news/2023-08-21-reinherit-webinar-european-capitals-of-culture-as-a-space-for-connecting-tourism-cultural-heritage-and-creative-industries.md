ReinHerit Webinars are aimed at cultural heritage professionals. They will consist of a *how to guide* for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.

The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 [ReInHerit](https://www.reinherit.eu) project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. 

### About this webinar:

The title of European Capital of Culture has become, in the last decade, a unique opportunity for small and medium size cities to valorise their cultural activities, their cultural heritage and local creative scenes by also boosting tourism, placing them on the European map of destinations. 

More and more, over the years, the cities bidding for the title are reflecting not only on their cultural strategies and offers but also how new forms of tourism could be linked to them to be more sustainable, respectful of the local heritage and local communities, allowing the visitors to fully experience local life and locals not to suffer gentrification processes and huge changes in their daily habits. 

The role of creative industries as promoter of innovation, fully in line with the concepts of the New European Bauhaus, has become more and more central in the bid books of the candidate cities and in the final programs of the selected one.

The webinar will explore these connections and dimensions by comparing the experiences of three European Capitals of Culture from the past (Kosice 2013), the present (Matera 2019) and the future (Chemnitz 2025) all of them with important experiences in connecting tourism, cultural heritage and creative industries and potential examples for future cities.
