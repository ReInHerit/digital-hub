![NEMO Members’ Meetup](https://ucarecdn.com/c15c6407-d8f3-4eec-8605-ae97b8a84c0e/ "NEMO Members’ Meetup")

The ReInHerit project was recently presented during a meetup of members of the Network of European Museum Organizations (NEMO)! It was a great opportunity to network and share the results of cooperative projects.

On June 12, 2024, NEMO members met online for the third edition of NEMO's latest networking event. This recurring event provides a unique platform for members to engage and connect exclusively with each other.

The session focused on networking and developing European cooperation projects. These projects provide a valuable opportunity to improve capacity, expand networks, and contribute to the broader cultural heritage sector.

Media Integration and Communication (MICC) and Muses Ltd Consulting and Management in Culture and Tourism shared their latest projects with NEMO. Paolo Mazzanti and Marco Bertini (MICC) presented the insights and results of the ReInHerit project. It was a great opportunity to network and disseminate the results of cooperative initiatives!
