Sibylle Dienesch, vice director of the [Graz Museum](https://www.grazmuseum.at/), will share her experience on (Co) Curating Traveling exhibitions.  She will bring us new insights on museum cooperation, as she is currently curating one of ReInHerit's traveling / digital exhibitions on "conflict, conflict management and conflict resolution" together with the [Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation](https://www.boccf.org/) and the [Museum of Cycladic Art](https://cycladic.gr/en).  

In this new episode of **Museums Up**, Sibylle will talk about interesting topics  such as what distinguishes these Travelling Exhibitions from others, or  how collaborative processes and curated exhibitions with international partner museums can work effectively.
