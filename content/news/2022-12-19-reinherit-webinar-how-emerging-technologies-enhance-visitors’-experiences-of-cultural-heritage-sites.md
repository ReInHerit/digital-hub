* The online webinar is limited to 50 participants on a first come, first serve basis. The webinar will be recorded and the recording video will be available in the [resources section](https://reinherit-hub.eu/webinars).

ReinHerit Webinars are aimed at cultural heritage professionals. They will consist of a *how to guide* for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.

The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 [ReInHerit](https://www.reinherit.eu) project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. 

### About this webinar:

The webinar will discuss ideas explored in the latest event created as a case study within the framework of ReInHerit: the immersive performance at the Mansion of Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios. This interdisciplinary performance required the collaboration of a diverse group of professionals and invited the audience to take initiative in shaping their experience of visiting the museum. The webinar will present ideas and lessons learned related to the following areas and how these can contribute to the creation and development of similar future initiatives in cultural heritage sites:

* combination of sound-installations with live music performers
* 3D scanning and printing of objects for a multisensory exhibition
* touch-reactive replicas of exhibits not accessible to the public
* remotely controlled movement-triggered sound installations
* site-specific lighting and video art design and projection
* pre-show dissemination strategies on social media
