ReinHerit Webinars are aimed at cultural heritage professionals. They will consist of a *how to guide* for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.

The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 [ReInHerit](https://www.reinherit.eu) project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. 

### About this webinar:

In recent years, a new round of technological revolution led by digital technologies such as robotics, big data, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, reverse engineering with 3D printing and scanning, virtual and augmented reality, are creating significant changes both in everyday life and in production and processing methods. These changes have huge implications for the global economy, industry and wider society as a whole.

They could not leave the world of culture untouched. Their contribution to the protection of archaeological sites and monuments in an environment of intense climatic phenomena is very important and is rapidly evolving through the application of technological achievements. By presenting the scope of these technologies and focusing on their application in the protection of archaeological sites and monuments, the need for interconnection and integration of new technologies with archaeological sites and monuments is highlighted.

Following the role of these emerging technologies, a novel practical approach will be presented that consists of risk assessment techniques and edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things. The practical, holistic and easily adaptable methodology will reveal how intelligent agent technology can have a significant impact, improving the way in which first responders and monument managers, even visitors, react to and handle risky or emergency situations. A pilot case study will emphasize how monuments and human lives can be protected and saved. The aim is to understand how right prognosis along with smart decisions will help prevent potential damage to the Cultural and Natural heritage without human losses.
