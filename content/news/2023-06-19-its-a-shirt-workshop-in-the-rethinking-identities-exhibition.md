The workshop "My Shirt | Myself" took place in the framework of the "ReThinking Identities" exhibition at the Museum of Cycladic Art. Young people and teenagers participated in this creative workshop and through design and stimulating conversation explored themselves and their identities. 


Drawing inspiration from a white unisex shirt by the brand IT'S A SHIRT by Christina Christodoulou, and under the guidance of the designer herself and mental health specialist Lily Peppou, the participants had the opportunity to share their personal experiences, discuss and create their own shirts, decorating them with symbols, designs, and colors that express themselves. The shirts created during the workshop were on display in the reception area of the Museum for a week, creating a mini exhibition within the exhibition.
