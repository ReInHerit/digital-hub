On November 27th, [The Hellenic Committee of the Blue Shield](https://www.hellenicblueshield.com) organised the international Conference “Cultural heritage, innovation and sustainable development: the contribution of ReΙnΗerit” in Athens. The goal of the conference was to assess the contribution of the ReΙnΗerit project to sustainable development, by bringing together policy makers, researchers and academics from various disciplines to discuss cultural heritage in relation to social, economic and environmental sustainability, as well as peace and security.

The conference was organised in four sessions, each focused to a different aspect of sustainability.

* ReΙnΗerit and social sustainability 
* ReΙnΗerit and economic sustainability 
* ReInHerit and environmental sustainability 
* ReInHerit, peace and security and sustainability

Each session included both ReInherit partners and guest speakers, who provided insightful presentations on the multifaceted sustainability of cultural heritage and its resilience during crises.



The first keynote speaker, Alexandra Xanthaki from Brunel University and UN Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, talked about “Cultural Heritage, Cultural Rights and Human Development”. The second keynote speaker, Dr. Celia Martinez Yanez of the ICOMOS International Committee on Cultural Tourism and ICOMOS Board Member, presented “The ICOMOS Charter for Cultural Heritage Tourism 2022: Aspirations for a Responsible and Right-Based Approach to Cultural Tourism.” The final keynote was by Peter Stone, President of The Blue Shield, who spoke on “Cultural Property: A Two-Edged Sword in Relation to Peace and Conflict”.

The conference provided a comprehensive platform for an open dialogue and in-depth discussions on cultural heritage and sustainable development. It highlighted the ReΙnΗerit project's significant contributions, underlining the project's impact on social, economic and environmental sustainability of cultural heritage and sustainability of cultural heritage in times of crisis. The event underscored the importance of collaborative efforts in preserving our cultural heritage while driving forward sustainable development.
