ReinHerit Webinars are aimed at cultural heritage professionals. They will consist of a *how to guide* for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.

The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 [ReInHerit](https://www.reinherit.eu) project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. 

### About this webinar:

What is the value of co-creative processes in the museum sector? How can museum-adequate exhibitions be created across locations and themes without the need to move original objects? What opportunities are opened up for museums through cooperation and engagement with different institutions?\
Sibylle Dienesch, Director and Curator at the Graz Museum, and Catalin Betz, Curatorial Assistant and Curator, will address these and other questions in a 60-minute webinar. The questions will be explained and presented on the basis of the project exhibitions created as part of the ReInHerit project, the[ Digital Exhibitions](https://reinherit-hub.eu/exhibitions) and the [Digital Collection](https://collection.reinherit-hub.eu).
