“ReInHerit in Performance: The Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios Mansion” is one of the events organized for ReInHerit “Redefining the Future of Culture Heritage: Creating an Innovative Model for Sustainability” ([http://www.reinherit.eu](http://www.reinherit.eu/)), coordinated by the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation. The performance is organized by CYENS Centre of Excellence, ReInHerit partner.

***How many layers of history are hiding in a medieval mansion in the heart of the old city of Nicosia?
Who were the previous residents of this emblematic building and what was their relationship to the creation of our city?
Who were the owners of the ancient relics that adorn the rooms of this house?
How many hopes and dreams fit within these walls?
What will this space look like in the future?***

**On 29 October we will look for the answers together!**

The immersive performance at the mansion of Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios combines a music performance, a sound installation, and a sensory exhibition in the spaces of a unique monument of cultural heritage. It is suitable for all ages and will be presented in three different starting times, for a limited audience.

The performance offers an innovative approach to the curation of the visitors’ experience within cultural heritage sites, for which we are creating an immersive experience within a museum. The performance consists of a temporary large-scale sound installation, which combines prerecorded sound and live electronics with a small group of musicians from the Cyprus Symphony Orchestra, video projection, theatrical lighting and multisensory haptic exhibits.

During the performance, the audience and performers navigate the spaces of the museum freely and trigger sonic events wherever and whenever they enter to explore, depending on the placement of the sound installation’s digital sensors. Thus, every visitor receives an individualised experience of the cultural heritage space, shaped by their personal choices on where to move to, what to focus on and for how long during the performance.

ReInHerit funding was secured in the framework of the Horizon 2020 CSA Programme, on the theme Culture beyond borders – Facilitating innovation and research cooperation between European museums and heritage. The Programme proposes an innovative model of sustainable cultural heritage management, aspiring to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites.
