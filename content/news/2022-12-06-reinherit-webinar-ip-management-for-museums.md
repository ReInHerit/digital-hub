ReinHerit Webinars are aimed at cultural heritage professionals. They will consist of a *how to guide* for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.

The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 [ReInHerit](https://www.reinherit.eu) project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. 

### About this webinar:

The operation of museums involves the management of their collections and other assets, which set a number of intellectual property (IP) issues. The seminar will focus on issues pertaining to IP Management and in particular on how museums can be assisted to set up processes to identify, organize, own, create value, license, disseminate and generally deal with and leverage ‘business’ opportunities in relation to content. That means a) effectively protecting their IP assets, b) preventing the infringement of third-party IP rights, and c) disseminating content as they see appropriate.
