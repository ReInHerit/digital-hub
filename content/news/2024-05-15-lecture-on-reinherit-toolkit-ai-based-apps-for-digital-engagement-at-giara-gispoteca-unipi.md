Motivations for the design of the Toolkit were presented and students tested the AI-based tools of the ReInHerit H2020 project. This  with GiARA has enabled some artworks to be added to the online galleries of [Face Fit](https://reinherit-hub.eu/tools/apps/051e7d78-de61-4e04-8b05-ab6f7a184153), [Strike A Pose](https://reinherit-hub.eu/tools/apps/de7756ad-67f6-4b6d-823e-0ce12f3f6c0d), and [VIOLA Multimedia Chatbot](https://reinherit-hub.eu/tools/apps/543b2b77-35f1-41b5-b06e-3a355f2a1c6b) in order to test content accuracy with curators and with the goal of redesigning the museum's interaction experiences and educational content.
