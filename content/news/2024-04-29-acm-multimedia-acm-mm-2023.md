MICC researchers participated to the **ACM Multimedia Conference 2023** held from 29 October-2 November, 2023 in Ottawa, Canada. ACM MM 2023 is the foremost international conference on multimedia, and is a forum to leading researchers from academia and industry to present and share their latest findings in multimedia research

A novel multimodal image retrieval system, that combines images and texts has been presented by two MICC researchers within the **Technical Demo track**, titled “[Zero-Shot Image Retrieval with Human Feedback”.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3581783.3612664)

At the ACM Multimedia 2023 Workshop n **Deep Multimodal Learning for Information Retrieva**l was instead presented the novel technique for Composed Image Retrieval, titled “Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval with Textual Inversion”, that allows to implement composed image retrieval techniques without the need to create expensive training datasets. This novel approach allows to use this technique also in domains were the creation of **datasets is expensive or not practical such as in Cultural Heritage**.
