ReinHerit Webinars are aimed at cultural heritage professionals. They will consist of a *how to guide* for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.

The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 [ReInHerit](https://www.reinherit.eu) project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. 

### About this webinar:

Narration and storytelling are central and powerful tools at the disposal of museums and cultural heritage institutions. Narration and storytelling can take different forms. The development and presentation of an exhibition, the design of an educational programme for children, guided tours and books all are based on narration and storytelling techniques. These techniques unfold the interesting story of different objects of a museum, revealing their origin and new context within the museum they are placed in. This webinar aims at presenting the key uses of narration and storytelling in a museum context in relation to different museum activities, also featuring case studies and examples from the Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens, Greece.
