The teams of CYENS and the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation worked closely to a) create 3D models of artifacts from the collection of the foundation and b) to collect appropriate information about each of the artifacts to be embedded in the game. This blog post gives a brief overview of the how the 3D reconstruction was done.

The team of ReInHerit created the 3D artifacts of the project using a process called photogrammetry. Photogrammetry is a technique used to measure and record physical spaces or objects, translating them into digital 3D models.  The process involves capturing multiple overlapping photos of an object from different angles. These photos are then analyzed and matched using software like Reality Capture, Metashape or Meshroom, which is a free and open-source 3D Reconstruction Software.  These software identify points between the photos and build a highly accurate 3D representation of the artifact.  This method was chosen because it does not require specialized equipment and can be done in-place inside the museum, allowing for the digitization of valuable artifacts without the need for transportation. To get high quality images, the artifacts were placed on a rotating platform in front of a black matte surface. The experts of BoCCF were moving around the object using gloves and making sure everything was handled respectfully.

The team also used Blender, a free and open-source 3D creation suite, to optimize the models by reducing the vertex/face count using a Decimate modifier.  This process helps to optimize performance by reducing the complexity of the 3D models based on their distance from the player's viewpoint. Additionally, metadata associated with the artifacts, such as category, period, style, material, dimensions, and description, was fetched from the BOCCF online collection to provide descriptive information about each artifact in the game. Links to more detailed information about each artifact were added in the game.
