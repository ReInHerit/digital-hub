📣 ReinHerit Toolkit will be presented at the XR&AI Summer School in Matera, Italy from July 17-22, 2023! 🌞

🎉 Italian partners of the ReInHerit Project, Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC) and MATERAHUB, are excited to organize workshops and lectures on Innovative and Sustainable Approaches for User Engagement and Digital Interaction with Cultural Heritage. 🏛

🔍  Discover how cutting-edge CV and AI technologies enable visitors to engage with museum collections and exhibitions in a playful manner, employing gamification and learning-by-doing techniques. In the lecture, the technical requirements for the development of this type of applications will be explored and the computer vision techniques useful for implementing such interactions will be discussed. 

💡But that's not all! Participants will have the opportunity to engage in hands-on activities and workshops, where they can use, test, and explore the Toolkit. Through a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, linking technology and culture, participants will co-create and adapt these tools based on their own ideas and needs. Expert input from technology and museum professionals as well as cultural communities will guide this networked, collaborative and participatory experience.
