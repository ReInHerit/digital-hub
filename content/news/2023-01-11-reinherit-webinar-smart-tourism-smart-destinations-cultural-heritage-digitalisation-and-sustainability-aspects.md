ReinHerit Webinars are aimed at cultural heritage professionals. They will consist of a *how to guide* for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.

The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 [ReInHerit](https://www.reinherit.eu) project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. 

### About this webinar:

The Webinar will present and discuss the latest concepts and initiatives on **Smart Tourism** and **Smart Destinations**, in relation to cultural heritage, digitalisation and sustainability. In particular, the ‘Smart Tourism’ framework of the European Commission Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW) will be presented as well as the ‘Smart Destinations’ initiative of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). Smart tourism as defined by the EC responds to new challenges and demands in a fast-changing sector, including the evolution of digital tools, products, and services; equal opportunity and access for all visitors; sustainable development of the local area; and support to creative industries, local talent and heritage.  Smart Tourism is thus closely related to cultural heritage with digitalisation in sustainable cultural tourism development and promotion. The new ‘European Capital of Smart Tourism Award’ since 2019 has components of ‘Sustainability, Accessibility, Digitalisation, Cultural Heritage & Creativity’. Cultural Heritage aspects are about protecting and capitalising on the cultural heritage as well as local potential and its creative assets. A smart destination according to UNWTO is one with a strategy for technology, innovation, sustainability, accessibility, and inclusivity, along the entire tourism cycle: before, during and after the trip. The pillars that comprise a smart destination include sustainability, innovation, and technology, which are closely related to the scope of the ReInHerit Horizon2020 CSA.
