ReinHerit Webinars are aimed at cultural heritage professionals. They will consist of a *how to guide* for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.

The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 [ReInHerit](https://www.reinherit.eu) project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. 

### About this webinar:

This webinar aims at presenting the main strategy for inclusion and accessibility to museum collections for the hearing and visually impaired. Following the museum’s participation in European research programmes and the close collaboration of the department of Educational and Community programmes with associations of people with hearing and visual impairments, the museum has designed and implemented an inclusive strategy which is dynamic and constantly updated to cater to new research and audience needs. The webinar focuses on the case study of the programme “In touch with the Cycladic Civilisation” with examples of inclusive strategies, the development of a mobile showcase for a tactile experience of museum exhibits for the visually impaired as well as sign language use in the museum context
