Have you ever seen your colleagues twisting themselves into funny poses in front of a computer?

Well, we got to experience this at the recent Research Fair organized at the [Arcada University of Applied Sciences](https://www.linkedin.com/company/arcadauas/), one of the ReInHerit partners. We set up an app testing station with the support of ReInHerit partner MICC – [Media Integration and Communication Center](https://www.facebook.com/miccunifi) of the University of Florence, and lured researchers, lecturers and invited guests to try them out. The objective of this session was to test the functionality the demo version of the developed apps, particularly their playful approach and the level of user engagement and involvement in their use.

On offer were these apps developed for the ReInHerit toolkit by MICC: 

* [Face-Fit](https://reinherit-hub.eu/tools/apps/051e7d78-de61-4e04-8b05-ab6f7a184153)
* [Strike a Pose](https://reinherit-hub.eu/tools/apps/de7756ad-67f6-4b6d-823e-0ce12f3f6c0d)
* [Smart Lens](https://reinherit-hub.eu/tools/apps/1e20d094-391f-40d4-820f-84423e30cec4)
* [Multimedia Chatbot](https://reinherit-hub.eu/tools/apps/543b2b77-35f1-41b5-b06e-3a355f2a1c6b)

These playful and educational apps are aimed at making a visit at a museum or cultural heritage site more engaging and interactive. It was fantastic witnessing the tester twisting arms up, torsos inclining left and right, fitting faces onto famous works of art – entertainment combined with enlightment and learning. 

It was an opportunity to learn from the interaction with users on how to improve our tools according to their needs and suggestions. Involving users is key to mediating meaningful dialogues and paving way for innovation. 

> “This event is an opportunity to learn from each other, to exchange ideas and insights, and to foster new collaborations that will drive forward new innovations and discoveries.”, said Dean Henrika Franck, as she opened Arcada’s Research Fair.

The response was enthusiastic and users pondered how these apps could be applied to other sectors that Arcada provides education to like nursing sciences and physiotherapy. Experimentation with these prototypes has thus resulted in cross-fertilization and scalability of ideas.
