ReinHerit Webinars are aimed at cultural heritage professionals. They will consist of a *how to guide* for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.

The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 [ReInHerit](https://www.reinherit.eu) project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. 

### About this webinar:

This webinar will consider methods and possibilities for digital audiences research and digital engagement evaluation. In a period in which museums are increasingly adopting digital tools for mediating and communicating with their audiences, aiming to foster participation and reach a broader set of publics, it is becoming increasingly important to also develop clearer evaluation methods for analysing the impact of these digital initiatives. Although digital audience research has a longer history, during the last decade – and in particular in the recent COVID-19 years – the need for clear workflows, benchmarks, and data practices to gather and analyse the experiences of online visitors and users of our digital applications has become a priority for the sector.

This webinar will briefly introduce the context in which these studies have been developed and, subsequently, focus on qualitative and quantitative methods for researching digital audiences and analysing digital engagement.
