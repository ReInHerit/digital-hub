ReinHerit Webinars are aimed at cultural heritage professionals. They will consist of a *how to guide* for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.

The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 [ReInHerit](https://www.reinherit.eu) project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. 

### About this webinar:

Aligned with the idea of proposing a sustainable model of heritage management, as established in the ReInHerit project, the purpose of this webinar is to provide guidance and tips on basic principles of sustainability for professionals working in museums and cultural heritage sites. This webinar will clarify ideas on the concepts of museum and sustainability, leading to a better understanding of the role of the 21st-century museum and its challenges and opportunities to create more public value in the context of social and environmental sustainability. Through effective guidelines and recommendations, the webinar will help to encourage cultural heritage professionals to implement sustainable practices in their daily museum management.
