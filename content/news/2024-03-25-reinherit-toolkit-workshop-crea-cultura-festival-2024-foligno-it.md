Prompting visitors to use AI-based applications and participate in playful experiences to foster engagement and facilitate learning processes within emotional and interactive museums.

Interesting **takeaways** and insights that emerged from the discussion:

> * The Chatbot responds correctly to several questions and “prompt" helps in this direction. 
> * Mainly it doesn't answer questions about visitors' curiosities, the ones that the curators didn't write in the description forms.
> * FaceFit works with different skin-tones. It worked correctly with both whites and blacks.
> * The reaction of the young students during the interaction experience was enjoyment, enthusiasm, and smiles. Some wanted to receive the result of the interaction via e-mail, despite the fact that it was only a test.
