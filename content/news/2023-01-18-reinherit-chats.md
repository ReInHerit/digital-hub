W﻿ith this week, we are launching a ReInHerit chat series: ﻿join us in the ReInHerit forum, on Wedenesday at 16:00 CET for an informal chat on cultural heritage management, sustainability, cultural tourism, and the role of digital technologies in fostering and supporting the sector!

Everyone is welcome to participate, share their experiences, and contribute to the discussion. W﻿e will meet at 16:00 and a moderator will introduce the theme of the chat, with a few prompts for discussion. The chat is organised so to last for about an hour.

**In order to join, please follow these steps**:

1. Go to our Forum ([accessible via this page](https://reinherit-hub.eu/networkinghub))
2. Click on the “Reinherit-Chat” room. If you cannot find it, [use the direct link](https://gitter.im/ReInHerit/ReInHerit-Chat)
3. At the bottom of the webpage, you will see an orange button “Sign in to start talking”. Click on it!
4. A pop-up will prompt you to login: you can sign in using your Twitter account or your GitHub account – both are perfectly fine, it just depends on your preference (if you don’t have an account on one of these two platform, you will need to first create the account – either on GitHub or on Twitter – and then come back to this step to sign in)
5. Once you are logged in, you will see the page. At the bottom, there is a white box in which you can type your messages: type your first “hello!” to test it.

You’re in, and ready to chat!\
