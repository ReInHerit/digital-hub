* The online webinar is limited to 50 participants on a first come, first serve basis. The webinar will be recorded and the recording video will be available in the [resources section](https://reinherit-hub.eu/webinars).

ReinHerit Webinars are aimed at cultural heritage professionals. They will consist of a *how to guide* for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.

The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 [ReInHerit](https://www.reinherit.eu) project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. 

### About this webinar:

This webinar gives an overview of low-threshold technologies for creating 3D models with photogrammetry. Photogrammetry is a technology that uses photos of objects to convert them into a digital 3D model with the help of specialized software tools. In recent years, the technology has become increasingly easy to access and use even for people who do not have a background in imaging technology. It holds potential for museums and Cultural Heritage institutions who are interested in exploring new ways of digitizing, preserving, exploring and exhibiting Cultural Heritage objects while working with a limited budget. The webinar discusses the basic photogrammetry process by showing hands-on example cases. It will focus on the technical requirements and challenges in creating 3D models with photogrammetry, with a special focus on potential issues in working with Cultural heritage objects. After the webinar, participants will have a basic understanding of the photogrammetry process, will be familiar with potential challenges and issues in digitizing objects with photogrammetry and will have the foundational knowledge to test out photogrammetry themselves.
