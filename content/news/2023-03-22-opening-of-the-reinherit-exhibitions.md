**The Museum of Cycladic Art, the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation and the Graz Museum invite you to the joint online opening of the project exhibitions:

The three partner museums – Museum of Cycladic Art (Athens), Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation (Nicosia) and Graz Museum (Graz) – will jointly present their co-curated exhibitions and the underlying travelling exhibition concept. The event will give insights into a shared growing Digital Collection, three Digital Exhibitions and the three museum exhibitions ReThinking IDENTITIES, ReThinking CRAFTSMANSHIP and ReThinking CONFLICTS.

The exhibitions and the collection are part of the EU-funded project "ReInHerit - Redefining the Future of Cultural Heritage".
We are looking forward to virtually connecting the three exhibition venues and to welcoming you online at the joint opening. 

The event will be held in English.\
