Marco Bertini and Paolo Mazzanti from MICC - University of Florence presented a practical lecture on 'Innovative and sustainable approaches for user engagement and digital interaction with cultural heritage'. Adopting a sustainable and user-centred approach, the aim was to share relevant results of the playful approach and user engagement studies conducted within the ReInHerit H2020 research project. Cutting-edge applications based on artificial intelligence developed by the Media Integration and Communication Centre were presented to inspire the students' project proposals. Participants were invited to use, test, and explore the Toolkit in a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, linking technological and cultural sectors.

Young PhD students worked in an interdisciplinary way on the ReInherit web apps Strike-a-Pose/Face-Fit and SmartLens/VIOLA Multimedia Chatbot using open-source codes shared by the Digital Hub.  During the creative hackathon, the proposal on ReInherit focused on two main themes: 'Gamification and playful approach' and 'Smart Interaction and digital contents'. This co-creation process added new technological developments for apps and user interaction scenarios, improving engagement, inclusivity and new design features.  The Strike-a-Pose 2.0 project proposal was awarded as the best and evaluated according to criteria of coherence, originality and innovation, technological quality and communication skills.
