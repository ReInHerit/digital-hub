MICC researchers participated in the **[15th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference](https://2024.acmmmsys.org)** held from 15-18 April, 2024 in Bari, Italy. **MMSys 2024** provides a forum to leading researchers from academia and industry to present and share their latest findings in **multimedia systems.** A unique opportunity to investigate the intersections and the interplay of the various approaches and solutions developed across these domains to deal with multimedia data types.

**DEMO**, titled **["Context-aware Chatbot using MLLMs for CulturalHeritage](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3625468.3652193)**, focused **Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs**) that are revolutionizing the way we understand and interact with multimedia content, including in the field of **cultural heritage and museums**. Existing models face difficulties in accurately answering contextually relevant questions about visual content, limiting their usefulness in applications such as art learning support. Based on work conducted as part of the **ReInHerit Toolkit's [VIOLA Multimedia Chatbot,](https://reinherit-hub.eu/tools/apps/c01cc7e5-033c-4d07-a56f-4612f9f210b3)** the demo presented an innovative approach that integrates contextual descriptions of artworks to improve the answering of visual questions, addressing a crucial need in cultural heritage interpretation. It highlights the need for chatbots that function with scientific accuracy, free of hallucinations, to provide reliable information in the cultural domain.

A great opportunity to present the results achieved to the **scientific community**, introducing the system **architecture**, the chatbot **dataset**, **design** considerations, discussing possible developments and **challenges**, following the **chatbot test** carried out with the community of international researchers attending the Conference.
