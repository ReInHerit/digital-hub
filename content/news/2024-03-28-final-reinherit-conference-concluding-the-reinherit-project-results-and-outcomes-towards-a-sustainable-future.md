The BoCCF recently concluded the final conference of the ReInHerit Project: 'Concluding the ReInHerit Project: Results and Outcomes Towards a Sustainable Future'. Held from January 16th to 18th, the event marked a pivotal moment in the journey toward sustainable cultural heritage management and innovation.

 Throughout the conference, participants engaged in dynamic sessions covering diverse topics such as legal and policy issues, cultural entrepreneurship, ethics and AI, audience engagement strategies, and sustainable tourism based on cultural heritage. Notable highlights included discussions on IP management, due diligence practices, and policy recommendations from the Athens ReInHerit Blue Shield Conference.

The conference also featured a walking tour in Nicosia and a study visit in Larnaka, providing attendees with firsthand experiences of cultural heritage sites and initiatives. Participants explored the old city of Nicosia and important landmarks of the city, where they had the opportunity to test the Smart Tourism App, an outcome of the project. 

During the study visit in Larnaka, various small and medium-size museums were visited, amongst them the Craft of Caning Museum in Livadia, the Archaeological Museum of the Larnaka District, the Pierides Museum - Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation, the Mattei House, as well as a walking tour in the old city of Larnaca in collaboration with the Larnaka Tourism Board. 

The conference, organised within the framework of the "Redefining the future of cultural heritage, through a disruptive model of sustainability (ReInHerit)" Project, received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.
