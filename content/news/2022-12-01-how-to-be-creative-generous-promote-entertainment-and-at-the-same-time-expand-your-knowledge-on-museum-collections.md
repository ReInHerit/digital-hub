The ReInHerit Eshop gives you the solution! Through this online shop you will have the opportunity to **\#MAKEYOUROWN** games, gift cards, weekly planners and many other. You can then spend your time creatively or offer them to your loved ones.

Some of the E-shopâ€™s items are designed especially for children. This is an opportunity to PLAY WITH YOUR KIDS!

The ReInherit E-shop is the result of collaboration between three museums, the Cycladic Museum, the Graz Museum and the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation. They have proposed a few of the artefacts from their collections to serve as inspiration for the printable digital items of the E-shop. This is an opportunity to LEARN AND EXPLORE, through the experimentation with the items, the collections of the three Museums.
