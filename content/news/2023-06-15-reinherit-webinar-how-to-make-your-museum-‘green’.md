ReinHerit Webinars are aimed at cultural heritage professionals. They will consist of a *how to guide* for small and medium-sized museum and cultural heritage organizations that documents processes, provides instruction, technical requirements and best practices for co-creation and collaboration between museums and cultural heritage institutions.

The Webinars are organised in the context of the  Horizon2020 [ReInHerit](https://www.reinherit.eu) project, that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, in a sense that it will connect cultural heritage collections and sites, and present Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists in their wider historical and geographical contexts. The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprises cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites. 

### About this webinar:

The aim of this webinar is to highlight the need for the cultural heritage sector to deal with important issues that are related to climate and environmental concerns. The speakers will present innovative sustainability and climate action practices that can be integrated into various aspects of museums, other cultural institutions and sites sustainability planning. The discussion examines and tries to explain the concept of ‘energy efficient’, ‘sustainable’ or ‘green’ museums. The aim is to assist professionals in the challenge they face in their climate action. Adapting a Green strategy will strengthen the quality of the environmental assessment procedure, align that procedure with the principles of smart regulation, and enhance coherence and synergies with EU legislation and policies.
