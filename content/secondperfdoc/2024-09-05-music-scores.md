The scores are split into three separate instrumental groups (strings, woodwinds, brass) and a percussion soloist. The video score is for the finale where all performers play together. Each part has its own instructions on locations and timings. The musicians combine their sounds with the audio coming from the interactive sound installation set up in the museum/performance space.
