title: Accessibility and inclusivity changes in small and medium-sized cultural
  institutions
desc: In 2023, the BoCCF, a small to medium-sized cultural institution,
  underwent significant transformations to enhance accessibility for all. With
  the establishment of the "Aisthiseis" programme, the BOCCF emphasised the need
  for accessibility and inclusivity by integrating permanent adaptations such as
  sign language tours, audio guides, tactile stations, and Braille guides. These
  changes not only facilitate the engagement of vulnerable groups within the
  museums but also extend the multisensory experience to its events. The
  commitment to training staff and the introduction of specialised workshops,
  reflect the BOCCF’s dedication to creating an inclusive and culturally
  enriching environment for all visitors.

resourcesbestpractice: "Implementing the \"Aisthiseis\" programme and
  specialised workshops at BOCCF requires financial backing for development,
  skilled professionals, as well as for replicas of artifacts. Human resources
  include trained staff, while infrastructure demands accessible spaces and
  virtual capabilities (eg. QR codes for sign language videos). Collaborations
  with external organisations, marketing efforts, and feedback mechanisms
  contribute to the programme's success. Additionally, adaptive tools,
  administrative support, and continuous improvement initiatives are vital.
  Community engagement strategies are essential for broadening participation.
  Securing these resources enables small to medium-sized cultural institutions
  to offer inclusive programmes, creating positive community impact and
  improving the overall cultural experience. "
successbestpractice: "Evaluating the effectiveness of the BOCCF’s ‘Aisthiseis’
  programme involves a comprehensive examination through various means. These
  assessment methods encompass diverse aspects, from participant feedback and
  participation rates to social media engagement.  Feedback: A cornerstone in
  evaluating the success of BOCCF's initiatives lies in the feedback received
  from participants. Consistently positive responses underscore participants'
  satisfaction with the Foundation's inclusive and accessible approach. For
  instance, the BOCCF held an art therapy workshop aimed for people over 60
  years old seeking to connect with themselves and tell their story. Forms were
  given where the participants were asked to circle how they feel at the
  beginning and at the end of the workshops, as well as any feedback they had.
  At the start and at the end of the workshop all participants said that they
  were ‘very happy’. They also stated that they felt grateful, calm, and
  highlighted the importance of these workshops for people who are over
  60.  Participation Rates: The robust engagement witnessed in the 'Aisthiseis'
  workshops serves as a compelling metric for success. In the year 2023, a total
  of 65 'Aisthiseis' workshops were held, indicating widespread community
  participation. This substantial turnout underscores the Foundation's
  commitment to inclusivity and accessibility, demonstrating its broad appeal
  and resonance with diverse audiences. Additionally, the 'Aisthiseis' workshops
  have seen substantial repeat participations, indicating the programme's
  enduring success and positive impact. This pattern highlights the sustained
  interest and enthusiasm generated by these inclusive and innovative cultural
  initiatives, showcasing the workshops' ability to captivate diverse audiences
  and provide lasting value to participants.  Social Media and Online Presence:
  Another dimension in measuring success lies in the BOCCF's social media and
  online presence. Collaborating with an external marketing agency, the
  Foundation aims for high engagement on its social media posts. Metrics such as
  likes, shares, and comments on these platforms provide tangible indicators of
  the ongoing success and relevance of the ‘Aisthiseis’ programme. Press
  releases distributed to Cypriot media further contribute to informing and
  attracting new audiences, enhancing the visibility and impact of the
  Foundation's cultural initiatives.  Adaptability and Flexibility: Evaluating
  the success of the programme can also involve measuring its adaptability and
  flexibility in response to the changing needs and interests of participants,
  ensuring ongoing relevance. The 'Aisthiseis' project serves as a prime example
  of impressive adaptability and flexibility, consistently adjusting to the
  evolving requirements and interests of participants. This interdisciplinary
  initiative has showcased its ability to modify its offerings, ensuring
  sustained relevance and dynamism. The workshops, characterised by an
  innovative approach to cultural engagement, underscore a commitment to
  adaptability, allowing the programme to connect with diverse audiences and
  cater to emerging preferences. By remaining responsive to the continually
  shifting landscape of cultural interests, the 'Aisthiseis' project sustains
  its efficacy and appeal, presenting a paradigm of adaptability and flexibility
  within the cultural institution's endeavors.  This multifaceted evaluation
  approach underscores the Foundation's dedication to providing enriching and
  accessible cultural experiences for all."
challengesbestpractice: The BOCCF grapples with the challenges inherent in
  implementing changes which emphasise accessibility and inclusivity, foremost
  among them being the imperative to attract new audiences and maintain
  relevance.   Recognising the need for constant revitalisation, a challenge for
  the institution, specifically for ‘Aisthiseis’ is that  it has to infuse the
  programme with new and captivating elements each month. This approach ensures
  that each iteration of the programme remains dynamic and responsive to the
  evolving expectations and interests of its diverse audience. A key strategy
  involves tailoring workshops to cater to diverse target groups, a nuanced
  process that considers the distinctive needs and preferences of each audience.
  This customisation is facilitated by a team of professionals, each possessing
  specialised expertise in certain areas, carefully selected to contribute to
  the richness and diversity of cultural experiences.  Through collaborative
  discussions, these professionals actively seek to rejuvenate and to
  continually enhance their workshops, adding new elements.  Another challenge
  is maintaining financial sustainability, especially for targeted programmes
  like 'Aisthiseis,' making the securing of funding vital for their ongoing
  success. Furthermore, maintaining relevance also demands adaptation to the
  ever-evolving educational landscape and technological advancements. This
  necessitates a continual assessment and integration of innovative
  methodologies while preserving the core values and aims of the programme. For
  instance, by enabling the creation of accessible content, thereby rendering
  cultural experiences more inclusive. In essence, the BOCCF's approach is
  rooted in an unwavering commitment to adaptability and audience-centric
  strategies, ensuring the sustained vibrancy and relevance of its cultural
  programmes.
transferbestpractice: The BOCCF's experience in implementing the "Aisthiseis"
  programme and specialised workshops offers valuable insights that can be
  transferred to other small to medium-sized cultural institutions, particularly
  those aiming to enhance accessibility and inclusivity. The key resource needs,
  including financial backing, skilled professionals, and adaptive tools, serve
  as a blueprint for institutions seeking to replicate inclusive programmes. The
  emphasis on collaboration with external organisations, robust marketing, and
  feedback mechanisms provides a model for community engagement, broadening
  participation and ensuring sustained relevance. The commitment to continuous
  improvement and adaptation to technological advancements sets a precedent for
  navigating the evolving educational landscape. The practice of tailoring
  workshops through collaborative discussions among professionals is a
  transferrable strategy, allowing institutions to meet the unique needs of
  diverse audiences. Importantly, the BOCCF's dedication to customising
  workshops and infusing new elements monthly demonstrates a dynamic approach to
  programme revitalisation that can be adopted by other institutions to keep
  their offerings engaging and responsive. The challenges faced, such as
  financial sustainability and the need for ongoing adaptation, also serve as
  lessons, encouraging similar institutions to proactively address these
  concerns for long-term success. Ultimately, the ‘Aisthiseis’ programme stands
  as an example for small to medium-sized cultural institutions seeking to
  transform their programmes, fostering accessibility, inclusivity, and cultural
  engagement.
infosbestpractice: In 2023, the BOCCF embarked on a transformative journey to
  enhance accessibility and inclusivity within its cultural institutions.
  Pioneering the ""Aisthiseis"" (Senses) programme, the BOCCF underscored its
  commitment to providing cultural access for all, aligning with the Bank of
  Cyprus ESG principles and the social development principles advocated by the
  H2020 ReInherit programme. This initiative encompasses permanent changes,
  including video-taped guided tours in Cypriot sign language, tactile stations,
  replicas of statues, vases, and coins, as well as audio guides and a Museum
  Guide.  Notably, these adaptations extend beyond the museums, permeating the
  entire annual programme of events with guided tours in sign language,
  multi-sensory experiences for vulnerable individuals, and inclusive practices
  across all cultural foundation events. The introduction of expert-designed
  workshops focusing on art therapy, museum education, therapeutic ceramics,
  experiential storytelling, and creative writing further amplifies the
  institution's dedication to fostering inclusivity in museum activities.  Under
  the motto 'More senses – Fewer Barriers – Better society,' the BOCCF not only
  enacts tangible changes within its premises but also places a strong emphasis
  on public awareness regarding vulnerable groups and the imperative for an
  inclusive society. This approach positions the BOCCF as a trailblazer in
  championing accessibility and inclusivity, setting a standard for small to
  medium-sized cultural institutions seeking to create culturally enriching
  environments for diverse audiences.

In the year 2023, the BOCCF emerged as a trailblazer among small to medium-sized cultural institutions in Cyprus through the implementation of its "Aisthiseis" (Senses) programme. This initiative highlights BOCCF’s commitment to encouraging accessibility and inclusivity within cultural spaces, particularly by integrating vulnerable groups into various cultural activities. Rooted in the belief that culture fundamentally defines societal identity, the "Aisthiseis" programme represents a transformative endeavor, highlighting the importance of providing inclusive cultural experiences for all. The notable changes instituted within BOCCF, including the introduction of sign language tours and Braille guides, not only meet specific accessibility needs but also elevate the overall cultural experience for the broader public. Going beyond the confines of traditional museum settings, the programme's innovative adaptation ensures inclusivity across diverse cultural contexts, signaling dedication dedication to embracing diversity in all its forms.

The BOCCF places strong emphasis on the training of its staff, as well as external individuals who express an interest in effectively engaging and catering to various vulnerable groups through the arts and culture. This commitment involves providing comprehensive training programmes that equip both internal personnel and external participants with the necessary knowledge and skills to better understand and meet the needs of diverse individuals through cultural activities. By actively engaging in training initiatives, the BOCCF seeks to enhance the competence of its staff and the wider community, creating an environment that is not only accommodating but also responsive to the unique requirements of these groups. Adopting the importance on training for engaging vulnerable groups through the arts and culture, is a strategic move for small and medium-sized cultural institutions. It not only aligns with societal values but also enhances community connections, visitor experiences, and overall institutional reputation. 

An example of the BOCCF forming a workshop for people who want to engage and cater to various vulnerable groups through the arts and culture, was an art therapy workshop that was held specifically for health professionals (therapists) with the objective of team-building. The prevalent themes that surfaced encompassed trust, collegiality, teamwork, family, and balance. Throughout the workshop, the exploration of synergy occurred through engaging activities such as play, movement, and working with clay material, transitioning from individual experiences to a collective context. The discussions raised various perspectives, realisations, and concepts, emphasising themes of journey, joy, love, balance, and family. As the session concluded, several participants expressed a desire to repeat the workshop, extending it to other groups of health professionals with whom they collaborate in the healthcare field.

The programme's dedication to tailored workshops, led by skilled professionals, addresses a range of topics including art therapy, museum education, clay therapy, experiential storytelling, and creative writing. These workshops cater to the diverse requirements of vulnerable groups. This ensures a broad array of meaningful connections and outlets for expression. An example of the specialised work carried out in the context of ‘Aisthiseis’ is observed in the art therapy workshop hosted in collaboration with a designated art therapist and the Autism Association Cyprus in Nicosia. Inspired by selected exhibits which ‘reveal their own history,’ the participants played with visual materials, for example through painting, to create material manifestations of their thoughts, feelings, and responses. This session offered the group a safer-practice framework for expressing emotions with colours on paper.

Another specialised workshop as a part of the ‘Aisthiseis’ programme that took place at the BOCCF, titled "Feel again", was an experiential storytelling workshop for pregnant women.\
A professional storyteller and musician guided several expectant mothers on a mystical journey. Latent senses and capabilities were stirred, traversing the various stages of a woman's life. Unraveling the intricacies of the symbolic red thread, participants underwent a distinctive multi-sensory encounter that brought back memories. Throughout this workshop, they interacted with diverse materials and narratives, recalling childhood flavors, mimicking sounds with their bodies, and allowing smells and colors to evoke sensations that encouraged the pregnant women to relive memories. On the whole, these specialised workshops led by skilled professionals can enhance the overall cultural experience for the participants, broaden audience reach, and establish a positive reputation for small to medium-sized cultural institutions.

The "Aisthiseis" project also includes a multi-sensory museum kit that travels to external sites and organisations, expanding the reach of inclusive practices. It aims to bring people who are far from museums in contact with museum objects. The museum kit involves accurate replicas of exhibits from the collections of the Foundation's Archaeological and Coinage Museum, which participants can touch and feel. Some examples of where it has travelled, include the elderly, by offering a workshop in the two units of the Materia Group, Materia and Thalpori, as well as to several summer schools and to the School for the Deaf in Cyprus.

Crucially, the BOCCF has actively sought collaborations with other organisations. These collaborations play a pivotal role in enhancing the overall visitor experience. By forming such partnerships, the BOCCF not only broadens its impact but also sets a standard for cultural institutions in promoting accessibility, diversity, and inclusivity. These collaborations not only enrich the cultural landscape but also reinforce the idea that cultural institutions can be powerful agents of positive social change. 
A notable exemplar of successful collaboration manifests in the partnership between the BOCCF and the School for the Deaf in Cyprus, specifically in the implementation of guided tours featuring sign language interpretation at the Foundation. These tours not only cater to the specific needs of the deaf community but also contribute to raising awareness about the rich cultural offerings available to diverse audiences. 

The volume of workshops conducted—65 in total for the year 2023—attests to the BOCCF's dedication to reaching a broad and diverse audience. In essence, the BOCCF's "Aisthiseis" programme serves not merely as a checklist of accessibility measures but as a holistic and integrated model, setting a high standard for creating enriching, accessible, and inclusive cultural spaces.
