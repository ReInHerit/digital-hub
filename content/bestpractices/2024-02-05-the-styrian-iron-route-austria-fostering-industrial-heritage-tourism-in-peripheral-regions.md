title: "The Styrian Iron Trail, Austria: Fostering Industrial heritage tourism
  in Peripheral Regions"
desc: The region of the Styrian Iron Trail is known for its rich mining and iron
  processing heritage with the still active Erzberg ore mine being an highlight.
  Additionally, the region also has a range of other cultural features (city,
  mineral, water works museums, etc.) present in various locations within the
  region. To raise the visiblity and professionalism of the cultural offer and
  its tourism value a museum association was founded. This best practice
  presents the work of the association and its benefits for the cultural
  heritage organisations in the area.

resourcesbestpractice: "The Association was founded thanks to the efforts of the
  involved museums: it needed therefore human resources (even if just on a
  voluntary base), and the financial support of the regional administration (AUT
  LEADER region Steirische Eisenstrasse)."
successbestpractice: The founding of the association has resulted in a series of
  benefits for the regional cultural organisations, by increasing engagement
  both inside the region (local visitors) and with national and international
  tourists. It has paved the way for a better access to funding, a better
  knowledge exchange between cultural institutions and a unified marketing
  product, resulting in a better outreach and appeal of the region cultural
  tourism routes and structures. One of the key success factors of the
  association was the gradual change in the relationship with many stakeholders,
  who acknowledged the difficulties in achieving funding for small museums and
  the limits of voluntary work. The inclusion of professional partners from the
  tourism and museum sectors helped to address these limitations and support the
  achivement of the organisationâ€™s aims.
challengesbestpractice: With the scope of museums being different, as well as
  their organisational structure, collections, and visitors numbers a range of
  issues, such as gaining a common understanding of each other needs, aims, and
  collection scopes, needed to be addressed. In addition, traditional regional
  rivalries were also posing a challenge and needed to be smoother, finding a
  common ground to overcome such differences. The association aimed to address
  these challenges, although many structural problems, such as the reliance on
  voluntary work in many of the museum sites, are still on-going challenges.
transferbestpractice: A joint museum association can be an important step to
  preserve cultural heritage, improve museum management and collaboration in a
  region, creating a more attractive and visible offer for visitors.It also
  safeguards (to a certain degree) the maintanance and survival of smaller
  cultural offers. It is therefore an attractive option for many regions.
  Nevertheless, the process has to be carefully prepared and moderated, so to
  overcome barriers in organisational cultures and achieve a sustainable and
  productive collaboration across all members.

In 2004, 12 regional museums in the region agreed to pool their resources and to form the Museum Association Steirische Eisenstrasse (Museumsverbund). The network is mostly composed of smaller heritage institutions with a narrow thematic focus. The overall aim of the cooperation is to raise the visiblity of the different small museums in the area and improve the cultural offer via the pooling of resources, the support for joint funding applications, and knowledge exchange between the participating institutions.
