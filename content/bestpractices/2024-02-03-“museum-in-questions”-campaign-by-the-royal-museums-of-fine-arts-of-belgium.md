resourcesbestpractice: "Works of art: The museum would need to have access to
  works of art that are related to the topic to be addressed.  Research:
  Extensive scientific research would be needed to shed light on the issues of
  colonialism and diversity, and the restitution of cultural property. This
  research would form the basis of the exhibitions."
successbestpractice: "Provenance investigation: A team of experts would be
  needed to investigate the provenance of artworks, particularly those of
  questionable origin. This is a laborious task but essential to the restitution
  process.  Information panels: Detailed information panels would be needed to
  provide context and answer questions about the artworks and topics being
  addressed.  Inclusive policies: The museum would need to implement inclusive
  policies to ensure that exhibitions are non-discriminatory and responsive to
  public reactions.  Facilitation of dialogue: Resources would be needed to
  facilitate constructive dialogue around the issues raised by the exhibitions.
  This could include guided tours, discussion forums or interactive exhibits."
challengesbestpractice: The main challenge is to be able to count on the
  facilities at the political level from the management areas of the museums to
  open dialogue to controversial social issues. The next challenge is to design
  a speech appropriate to the understanding of the general public in order to
  communicate the importance of topics such as decolonization in museums without
  offending the collective's sensitivities.
transferbestpractice: The initiative can be adapted to museums that have in
  their collections works obtained under conditions similar to those of this
  museum. The initiative to address a controversial topic requires, for its
  adaptation to different museums or institutions, the support of the management
  and an adequate museography in terms of respectful discourse. In the case of
  discussion sessions, it is essential for their adaptation to count experts on
  the topics as spikers.

  study visits in Brussels by ReInHerit Horizon 2020 CSA partners in May 2023.

As part of the “Museum in Questions” campaign initiated in the fall of 2021, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium are eager to join the debate on current social issues. Two exhibition rooms contextualize two burning topics for museums around the world: on the one hand, they shed scientific light on the issues of colonialism and diversity, and on the other hand, on the problem of the restitution of cultural goods looted during the Second World War. The Royal Museums aspire to be a laboratory for reflection that will enable us to participate in the construction of the museum of tomorrow, insisting on how scientific research, one of the museum’s primary missions, can contribute to the contemporary debate.

One exhibition room focuses on the complex issue of looted artworks, particularly those taken during World War II. The process of identifying such works involves thorough provenance research, which can be challenging but is essential for restitution.

Another room addresses the responsibility of museums to be inclusive and non-discriminatory, exemplified by the renaming of a Rubens masterpiece. This action reflects the museum’s commitment to fostering a scientifically based debate, acknowledging historical facts and contexts, and responding to public reactions.

In summary, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium are using these exhibitions as a platform for reflection and dialogue on important social and historical issues, demonstrating the role of museums as more than just repositories of art, but as active participants in societal discourse.
