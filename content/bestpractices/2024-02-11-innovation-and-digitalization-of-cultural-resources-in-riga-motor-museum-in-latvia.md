Riga Motor Museum was opened after a large-scale reconstruction on the 2nd of July, 2016. The museum has gained broader and modernized exposition space, a comfortable and enjoyable environment for visitors, as well as accessibility for everyone. At the same time they have preserved the museum’s historical architecture and the specific Motor Museum’s atmosphere.

\
The design project envisages the creation of an entirely new innovative Riga Motor Museum exposition with interactive and multimedia solutions, highlighting the museum’s collections and unique exhibits. Organically integrated in the museum’s exposition the multimedia solutions complement the overall narrative. They allow the visitor to explore important topics in depth, engage creatively and gain visual enjoyment. Here are some examples – audio guide, augmented reality experience, video mapping show, workstations, visual projections, multimedia solutions, audio experience, hands-on exhibits and games.

\
The main reason for the reconstruction was to create an attractive museum that would engage all range of people to visit the museum (different ages, families etc.) and have a repetitive visit.

\
The museum is included in the list of the best technical museums in the world.



This is an inspiring example of using innovative digital solutions to increase the attractiveness of a museum in Latvia and improve visitors’ experience. The approach demonstrated positive results, as evidenced by the increased number of visitors and international recognition. The experience of the Latvian museum can be helpful for other museums aiming to improve visitors’ experience and raise their interest in cultural heritage assets.
