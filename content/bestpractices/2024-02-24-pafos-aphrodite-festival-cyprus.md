transferbestpractice: "Pafos Aphrodite Festival constitutes an annual cultural
  event organised by PAFC at the Square of the Medieval Castle in Pafos (Kato
  Pafos Harbor) presenting three performances of an opera work.  This event
  offers great potential for learning by and transfer to other regions and
  cities, given that the opera productions are imported from well established
  locations with long tradition on opera. The setting and the international
  audience of holiday-makers and visitors can be replicated in other
  destinations to enhance the role of intangible heritage in sustainable
  cultural tourism development and promotion.  The means required to organise
  such an event are: - a dynamic team of both cultural and tourism professionals
  - a strong leadership by local/regional authority policy-makers - artistic
  capacity to select the opera company every year - financial support through
  sponsorship and ticket sales - effective marketing, and - involvement of the
  local community and stakeholders."
