resourcesbestpractice: The resources used is human resources. Several people
  from different departments in the municipalities need to work together having
  a common goal, aim and budget for their prioritized routes. They need to
  co-operate with people from the Region, national organisations, the Church and
  land owners.
successbestpractice: "Falköping municipality is an evidence. The only way to
  create and develop routes that lasts longer than 2-3 years in a forested,
  slightly populated area. Success factors: a long lasting organisation and
  management, political anchored decisions for budget and commitment, agreements
  for land-owners, municipalities, associations etc and hiking products
  containing the kind of route (nature, culture, safety, level, service) that is
  demanded from the new type of hikers."

transferbestpractice: We know that other regions in Sweden and countries with
  the same conditions as Sweden have the same challenges with their route
  management. Routes who disappears within 2-3 years if management is not taken
  care of, defective sign posting, different quality standards, unapproved maps,
  municipal politicians who do not know how a high-quality route that is
  long-term financed and organized, can contribute to rural development,
  development of existing and new companies, integration, improved public
  health, an attractive municipality to live and work in, strengthen social ties
  in local collaboration. By communicating the work process, tools and methods
  that is the result of this work, to municipalities and national organizations,
  we can gain a national / northern European way of working with sustainable
  routes and thus create the conditions for a better developed and above all
  socially, economically and ecologically sustainable nature tourism.

The interest and need to get into nature are increasing nationally and internationally. The hiker today has higher demands and expectations for the routes they are going to wander than before. At the same time, the thresholds are too high to find out and hike. Many routes do not hold quality, no one is in charge of the team or finance the development, service along the routes is missing, maps do not match reality and we do not have a common national quality standard for our routes, that is located outside the mountainous area, the lowland routes. Developing hiking routes in northern Europe is challenging, due to the routes in many cases are quite new, which creates conflicts with the landowners, long stretches of wilderness demands intensive management at high costs and to create service to live and eat along the routes is challenging. The practice includes: a working process, an evaluation of routes matrix and a model for sustainable organisation of routes. When working in this certain way we can go from status having routes of low quality with no management to a status where we have high quality routes with an organisation and infrastructure and service creating growth and jobs by developing hiking products demanded on an international market where quality goes before quantity. Stakeholders are the region, municipalities, SMEs, the Church and associations (cultural-, nature- and sports organisations, land owners).
