  Destination Bornholm has started additional digital  development in
  co-operation with the local municipality. Building on the Event Engine and
  easy usability of the  system, it has been decided to develop the online event
  calendar further to include tourist-related events and  events by clubs,
  societies, congregations, etc. Thus, creating the basis for a digital overview
  of all events and  activities on the island of Bornholm.
successbestpractice: "The project launched in 2019, and, unfortunately, the
  COVID-19 pandemic hit the travel industry hard. An  unforeseen development in
  the project affected the key performance indicators. However, during 2019 and
  2020, Destination Bornholm implemented the digital development described in
  the  previous sections and continued to lobby local businesses and partners to
  stay open during the winter.  As part of the ‘Event Engine’ digital
  development the following partners were automatically integrated
  into  Bornholm’s official travel guides in the app ‘Bornholm’ and on the
  website www.bornholm.info: Bornholm’s Museum (incl. all subdepartments)
  Svanekegården Grønbechs Gård Bornholm’s Teater Gaarden – Bornholm’s Food
  Culture House NaturBornholm Bornholm’s Art Tour Bornholm’s Culture Week It is
  estimated that these partners and others have contributed with several hundred
  new events through the  Event Engine and thanks to the usability upgrade.
  Dialogue with the newly established ‘Bornholm’s Christmas Market’ also helped
  create a strong reason-to-go.  The pandemic hit Europe hard in 2020 and
  2021and, closed borders and quarantine laws prevented international  travel to
  Bornholm. Especially the number of international tourists to Bornholm. In the
  winter months of 2020,  Bornholm lost over 90% of its international
  accommodation bookings compared to the previous year.  More open local
  businesses Luckily, Bornholm managed to attract Danes during the summer and
  Autumn to offset the lack of German,  Swedish, Polish, and other international
  tourists. The island’s popularity helped Destination Bornholm and
  our  partners persuade local businesses to keep their doors open during the
  winter. At the project's start, there were  208 registered open businesses on
  the island during winter, but in 2021 that number had increased to
  375.  Destination Bornholm could present tourists and locals with the best
  overview of everything Winter Island  Bornholm had to offer through digital
  platforms. More Guests and more revenues As the travel restrictions were still
  in effect during the winter of 2020 and (to some degree) 2021,
  Bornholm  became a popular winter destination for Danes. In 2020 Bornholm
  experienced a 29% increase in Danish  overnight stays. In the winter of 2021,
  this number increased by 144% and helped Bornholm’s tourism industry  through
  the pandemic. We estimate that during the winter months of 2020 and 2021,
  Bornholm’s tourism  revenue increased from an estimated 47 Mio. DKK to almost
  72 Mio. DKK – a 53% increase in times of a  pandemic. We believe this success
  was achieved based on this project’s goals of developing an innovative digital
  travel  destination that helped facilitate co-operation between local
  businesses, the local community, and tourists. "
challengesbestpractice: Increased online interest The digital development
  supported Destination Bornholm’s digital channels throughout the pandemic and
  helped the Danes find an opportunity to experience our beautiful Baltic
  Island. Unfortunately, we lack the precise data from our app due to technical
  issues at the time of this application, but  the digital development affects
  both our website and app. We experienced a 31% increase in traffic in
  2020  compared to 2019 (pre-pandemic) on the website. In 2021 (when all
  digital stages were implemented) we  experienced a 24% increase in traffic
  during the winter period. Based on the digital development in this project,
  Destination Bornholm has started additional digital  development in
  co-operation with the local municipality. Building on the Event Engine and
  easy usability of the  system, it has been decided to develop the online event
  calendar further to include tourist-related events and  events by clubs,
  societies, congregations, etc. Thus, creating the basis for a digital overview
  of all events and  activities on the island of Bornholm.

Bornholm is known as the “Sunshine Island” Historically, the Danish Island of Bornholm has always been known as a summer destination. For this reason, Bornholm has been nicknamed “The Sunny Island”. Destination Bornholm ApS has been working with local partners in the tourism industry, municipality, and other public and private entities to build a sustainable tourism destination since 1992. Through the years, both the Spring and Autumn months have seen a steady increase in visitors and helped prolong the season, benefiting the island through economic and social stability and growth. Turning a summer destination into a Winter Island In 2019 Destination Bornholm started a new project in cooperation with several local partners Danish Board of Business Development with the lofty goal of turning our island into a winter travel destination. The goal was to expand the tourism season into the winter months, thus creating opportunities to increase revenue for local businesses, create more full-time employment within the tourism industry and offer the island community a wider range of activities during the winter. We also realized that Bornholm is a very different destination compared to the summer months during the winter period. During the summer, every store, attraction, and shop is open and can cater to our guests, but most businesses hibernate until spring during winter. The closed businesses also limit the opportunities for the local inhabitants to experience their own island. Open for business However, several businesses are open during the winter season, and the project partners agreed to keep their doors open during winter. So even though there might be several closed doors, plenty of shops, eateries, attractions, and accommodations were now open. Enough to create a unique travel experience to Bornholm for any tourist during the winter period. For the benefit of the tourists AND the locals To help tourists find open local businesses (and promote those who were open), Destination Bornholm initiated a digital development project, partly funded by Danish Board of Business Development. The aim was to upgrade our local destination travel guide app, ‘Bornholm’, so the visiting tourist were given a tool that helped them navigate Winter Island Bornholm. As a side effect the locals started using the app to find open restaurants, shops, events. During 2019-2020 Destination Bornholm launched a three-stage digital development project to facilitate a smarter and more accessible travel destination. 

The development stages were: 

* Event Engine: Creating a unique overview of events on the island by creating an “Event Engine” that could automatically fetch event data from local partners and display them in Destination Bornholm’s app and on the website www.bornholm.info. This helped promote events during the winter period and optimized the time used for the event creators since they only had to create their event once (in their own system). Several local attractions implemented this Event Engine – incl. Bornholm’s Museum and Bornholm’s Art Museum. 
* Usability upgrade: Destination Bornholm has allowed our partners to update their information directly on the destination website and official travel guide app in a unique cooperation between a local destination agency and local businesses. The partners have a login and can edit their opening hours, images, contact information and create events directly in Destination Bornholms database. This procedure was initially developed in 2017 but optimized through a usability upgrade during this project. The upgrade makes it easier for businesses, locals, and event creators to access the system and promote their offers.
* Inspiration in the official app: To guide tourists to great travel experiences, the official travel guide app ‘Bornholm’ was upgraded to include inspiration articles that could highlight experiences available during their stay on the island. Through this new system Destination Bornholm can now display selected articles from the app in both Danish, German and English – such as “Sjove vinteraktiviteter for familier med små børn” (Danish for “Fun winter activities for families with small children”).
