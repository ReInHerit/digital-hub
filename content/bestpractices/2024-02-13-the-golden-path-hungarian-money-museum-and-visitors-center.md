  interpreter). Short description of our voluntary work: Secondary school and
  college students take part in giving information, ushering visitors and
  assisting in museum education sessions on special weekends. For responding to
  community concerns we have recently expanded our cloakroom facility for larger
  stuff of families arriving with children. The exhibition is now available in
  three languages: Hungarian, English, and Chinese. Museum facilities: - Museum
  education room, where in addition to the exhibition space, pre-booked museum
  education sessions can be held. - Museum café in the lobby is an excellent
  meeting place both for visitors, and anyone who just pops in to look around
  and get inspired to come to visit the museum. The café on the top floor of the
  spectacular corner tower of the building is to be opened soon. - Book Spot,
  also located in the lobby, offers professional, authentic, and up-to-date
  literature for understanding the most important topics in the modern economy.
  - Museum shop is also located in the lobby, where publications, museum gifts
  and souvenirs specifically for young people can be purchased. - Toilets are
  located on the - 1 floor (basement) in the cloak room area, and on the first

The Hungarian Money Museum, founded by the Central Bank of Hungary, serves the development of financial culture, and has a dual function: it houses the MNB numismatic collection as a museum, and
in line with the trend of the world’s central banks and museums it provides experiential knowledge transfer, i.e., entertaining, and engaging visitors.

Visitors’ experience - innovations
If anyone should be intimidated by the modern spectacle of the exhibition due to the many digital “gadgets” in the exhibition, we are happy to reassure everyone that no prior special training or additional knowledge of IT or finance is required, just a natural curiosity and openness to the subject, so the exhibition is accessible for everyone.

To be able to achieve our ambitious goal of engaging the widest strata of the public, and enhance visitors’ experience in all possible ways, visitors need to be amazed from the first moment they enter the museum due to a series of surprises that start to unfold:

* There are two robots moving around in the lobby, welcoming visitors and giving information about the museum. 
* The lockers are in the “gold mine” with a real gold nugget in the display where personalization of the RIF cards take place. 
* Stimulating state-of-the-art environment and technology in the whole museum space
* Accessible exhibition for everyone. The educational games related to the history and functions of money can be played by people of different educational backgrounds and intellectual abilities.
* Assistance is offered to visitors in each of the five parts of the exhibition.
* Competitive games provide a feeling of achievement.

The Path of Money 
Our permanent exhibition is aimed to be a unique entertainment for the general public with opportunities for education about the history of money. The exhibition tells the compelling story of how money has emerged through the centuries and evolved up to its present state – with some glimpses of the future of money (green finances and digital national banks, crypto currencies) – by providing an innovative interactive gamification experience i.e., experiential knowledge transfer, for children and adults, in a state-of-the-art digital technology environment, considered most modern in Hungary, Europe and the rest of the world.
The central element of the visitor experience is a story in the form of a game that spans over the exhibition, and can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, where they can collect virtual hypothetical assets by solving quizzes and game situations.
Visitors are part of the story, the proposed research, where they can experience for themselves why the milestones of the evolution of the economy (money, banking system, reserves, etc.) are so important. 
The gamification experience ensures fun and knowledge transfer for the players, who can increase their virtual financial wealth as they go through the exhibition by using their acquired knowledge.
The feeling of achievement is an important feature of the virtual wealth accumulation game, which can encourage players to participate again and achieve better results.
Within the main story line, there are several finance related stories from Hungarian history presented in the relevant parts of the exhibition. One of the most riveting and hugely popular stories is the “Story of the Gold Train of the Central Bank of Hungary”, about which an animated film can be watched on a tabletop display.

How technology is used to support the museum's work:
The operation of the Money Museum is based on technology. It provides visitors a unique experience through experiential knowledge transfer in the five nodes of the exhibition in an entertaining and engaging way. This magnetic tool not only attracts visitors, but they also stick around, inspired to come back for more “clicking”, which is undoubtedly a significant factor in increasing the number of visitors. Digital technology is also used in online booking, as well as the registration of the museum objects. 

Initiatives in the field of environmental and social sustainability:
The renovation of the museum building was completed last year, equipped with the most modern insulation and an efficient heating system.
The Money Museum takes responsibility for demonstrating its ecological attitude in all aspects of the building and its operation not merely to save energy, but also to promote sustainable methods that visitors might be able to follow. Our consciousness regarding energy manifests itself from keeping the temperature down at 18 degrees Celsius in winter, both in the exhibition and offices, through collecting waste selectively in the lobby and café, to the stools in Node III decorated with pieces of crushed (recycled) money withdrawn from circulation. 
To reduce the use of paper we channel promotional material onto social media platforms and website as much as possible. As admission is free to the museum and booking visits (which is mandatory before entering) takes place online, no paper is used for tickets or receipts.
Issues of sustainability and environmental protection are also included in Node IV. in the Future of Money installation, where the increasingly important field of green finance is touched on. We maintain special partnership with the Budapest Centre for Long-term Sustainability.
A series of museum education weekend programs titled Tales from the Money Museum is organized for families with small children, the topics of which include environmental issues such as Guardians of the Forest.
Although our primary target group is students in grades 7-12, the Hungarian Money Museum is on the right track to become a centre for financial education and culture in Hungary by providing guided tours and museum education (personal mediation) to school groups, families, individual visitors, professionals.

The museum functions as an extended experience space. We have professional relations
(competitions, national or international events, Book launches) with: 

* Money Compass Foundation
* Hungarian Schooling Networks
* Member of the Global Money Week Event
* ESCB
* Hungarian Economic Association
* Pallas Athéné Books

We are also present at student-centric events, such as:

* SZIN
* EFOTT, CAMPUS
* BME
* Museums
* Tusványos – Free Summer University
