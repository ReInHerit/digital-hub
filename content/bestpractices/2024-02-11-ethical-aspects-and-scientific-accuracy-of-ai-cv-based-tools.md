title: " Ethical Aspects and Scientific Accuracy of AI/CV-based tools"
desc: When working with AI in museums, especially with Generative Artificial
  Intelligence (GenAI), it is crucial to use a model that considers important
  critical aspects, such as the scientific accuracy of results and the ethical
  implications related to the use of personal and training data. In this regard,
  multimedia chatbot and AI tools based on Smart interaction with  the
  descriptive content of the  museum collection considered the fairness of the
  models used and compiled a proper ReInHerit Ethics Cards, to avoid ethical
  issues and errors.

successbestpractice: "Successful testing of the apps with diverse users (age,
  ethnicity, etc.): the apps have been tested in multiple venues with diverse
  users, without issues related to visual appearances. Collaboration with museum
  curators for the creation of the test datasets and collection of materials for
  deployment: the curators involved in the project have selected the artworks
  used, the describing materials and filled the ICOM-based cards describing the
  selected artworks Awards AI/CV communities: the scientific communities in
  multimedia and computer vision have awarded the developed applications in demo
  competition associated with the foremost scientific conferences in those
  fields."
challengesbestpractice: Specific areas of resistance within the museum due an
  old conservative mindset of a closed museum focused only on collections,
  objects and not on visitors’ interaction.  The Lack of digital skills by
  museum staff and mediation skills in all areas of technology and museums to
  create an interdisciplinary dialogue.  Lack of Data entry, Data sets,
  management Algorithmic bias, Legal roles and code of ethics.
transferbestpractice: The ReInHerit model cards could be used in other projects
  and processes, complementing the model cards used in AI/CV communities. The
  ReInHerit cards can open a connection between the Digital Hub and other CH
  projects and networks working on the introduction of AI in museums.
infosbestpractice: "The recent explosion in generative AI means that museums
  have to quickly adapt to the new landscape and understand how to make the most
  of it ethically. The ReInHerit Toolkit was presented as an Italian case study
  at the “Museums+AI Workshop” IULM AI LAB in Milan, Italy, on October 9th,
  2023, organized by Dr. Giuliano Gaia – InvisibleStudio and Dr. Oonagh Murphy,
  Goldsmiths University /AI+Museums Network. 12 The experience and reference to
  this important Network is useful for testing and updating the ReInHerit
  Toolkit following an interdisciplinary, sustainable, and up-to-date approach
  to the impact of AI in the museum world. Italian case studies from this
  workshop will be included in the Italian translation of AI: A Museum Planning
  Toolkit. "

Important steps and recommendations for **regulating GenAI** based on a **human-centered approach** include concerns related to the **Ethics** of AI Chatbots, user privacy policy compliance, training data, and the scientific accuracy of chatbot outputs. The development of artificial intelligence applications involved extensive training on datasets. Ensuring that the final training data is ethically sourced, unbiased, and devoid of discriminatory content is crucial for maintaining the ethical integrity of AI tools. 

* **Training data:** AI applications involved extensive training on large data sets. It is crucial to ensure that the final training is ethically sourced and respect the privacy of users.
* **Transparency**: Chatbot must be transparent about how the data is used and ensure that the data is stored securely and, where appropriate, anonymised.
* **Scientific accuracy**: Chatbot responses must be tested and validated by museums. This is especially important for applications that provide historical or scientific information to museum visitors through solutions that avoid AI “hallucinations”.

The ReInHerit project created **Ethics Cards** for the developed applications, considering fairness and all the ethical issues associated with a user-centered approach with AI/CV. These cards analyse different aspects of the applications such as **Training Data** (Dataset and Model cards used, bias discrimations) **User Data** (user data collection, privacy, transparency, use Third part…) **Data Security** (data protection, cyber-attacks) **Copyright aspects** (copyright for the training data)

To guarantee quality content, the descriptions of the artworks accessible to visitors during the Smart Interaction and the data used by the [**VIOLA Multimedia** **Chatbot**](https://reinherit-hub.eu/tools/apps/c01cc7e5-033c-4d07-a56f-4612f9f210b3) have been provided by by the Museums involved in the ReinHerit Project (GrazMuseum, Cycladic Museum, Bank of Cyprus Foundation) The content used by the chatbot is provided by curators using a specific interface. System do not rely on something “memorized” by the chatbot. The questions of the users are encapsulated in other instructions (prompt engineering) that instruct the chatbot to answer only using the curated material.
