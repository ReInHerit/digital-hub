resourcesbestpractice: It needs space at the museum and a website, both designed
  in a participatory way, as well as human resources at the museum who are
  willing to work also outside the "museum box".
successbestpractice: The project has become a real role model for participatory
  formats at the museums in the German-speaking countries. Current debates such
  as collecting the present, democratic museums and opening processes as well as
  the transfer of knowledge to society were initiated.
challengesbestpractice: In order to enable participation, the opening of the
  museum, the democratization of knowledge and knowledge transfer at eye level,
  a museum must give up its sovereignty of interpretation and engage with the
  knowledge and experiences of others.  It can be challenging for the museum
  staff to replace old patterns of behavior and old ways of working with new
  concepts and ideas. Participatory projects have a need for a lot of personell
  ressources, e.g. people who moderate and accompany these projects.
transferbestpractice: Numerous other city museums took up the idea o rparts of
  it and realized their own city lab projects, which, in contrast to the
  Frankfurt model, are mainly temporary in nature and were set up, for example,
  to prepare new museum concepts.

The City Lab has been up and running since 2010. It consists of three different formats:

1. CityLab on the move: To find out what life is like in Frankfurt, the museum team leaves the museum’s walls and they are on the move with the City Lab for some on-site research. They want to know how the city is subjectively perceived and experienced. And the best people to answer this are Frankfurters themselves, of course. Using different methods in participative city research, the City Lab is always on the move and invites the people to join new exhibition and event formats regularly. Since 2010 they have used it to create five large exhibitions together with many different Frankfurters. Moreover the City Lab touring with artistic interventions, workshops, city walks, readings...
2. CityLab at the museum
   The exhibition room “Frankfurt Now!”, a permanent and ever-changing/adapting exhibition and event space has 600 m2 space for the various activities of the City Lab. In this permanently installed City Lab, things can be stored and examined better than out in the field – in other words, different research and experiments can be carried out.
3. Digital CityLab
   Digital City Lab is a website that has transferred the City Lab concept to a digital platform for users. The user space is a digital map of the city on which places can be marked and expanded with the stories and knowledge of Frankfurters. The users can tell their stories digitally with video and audio contributions, photos and texts. It’s all about collecting experiences, personal stories, special relationships with particular places, different ways of using the city together and about data that opens up new perspectives. The focus is on depicting polyphony: the plan is to build an audio-visual, multi-perspective and ever-changing city portrait shaped by user contributions.
