title: Training Webinars
desc: "Webinars have emerged as a preferred tool for guidance and training, well
  known for their easy accessibility, especially since the pandemic. Webinars
  stand out as a best practice for training professionals on digital tools and
  related issues. ReInHerit project conducted primary and secondary research
  with interviews, focus groups, and surveys with museum and cultural heritage
  professionals to identify tools and activities to be developed. This approach
  enabled the Consortium to achieve its goal of developing valuable tools and
  essential resources for inclusion in the online platform (Digital Hub). The
  results suggest that small and medium-sized organisations are more likely to
  adopt digital tools with adapted documentation and guidance. "

successbestpractice: The success of the ReInHerit project is also linked to the
  central role played by webinars in creating a dynamic and inclusive learning
  environment. Leveraging the potential of digital platforms, these webinars not
  only fostered collaboration and disseminated knowledge but also played a
  crucial role in building a robust network of experts within the museum sector.
  One of the primary achievements of the webinars was the creation of a
  comprehensive list of registered professionals and webinar participants. This
  list serves as a valuable resource for promotion and dissemination, showcasing
  the extensive network of over 200 museum professionals who actively engaged in
  multiple online webinar sessions. The diversity of participants from different
  institutions enriched the collaborative spirit of the project, contributing to
  an interdisciplinary perspective on the challenges and opportunities of the
  museums and cultural heritage sectors. The webinars focused on macro-topics
  such as technology, management, tourism, and other relevant issues aligned
  with the activities of the ReInHerit project. Consortium experts and cultural
  heritage professionals led these sessions, providing in-depth insights and
  addressing the specific interests of the participants. This approach not only
  facilitated knowledge sharing but also ensured that the content remained
  tailored to the needs of the museum professionals. The recorded webinar
  sessions, accompanied by training materials, stand as enduring resources for
  professional development in the museum sector. These recordings, published
  online, enable interested professionals to revisit the content and derive
  ongoing benefits from the valuable insights shared during the live sessions.
  The accessibility of these resources extends the impact of the webinars beyond
  the live events, creating a repository of knowledge that continues to
  contribute to the growth and development of museum professionals. The material
  from all webinars was used to develop a comprehensive curriculum document and
  training syllabi. This document serves as a structured guide for further
  learning and development in the museum sector, capturing the essence of the
  experience shared during the webinars. The evidence of success lies not only
  in the numbers and the vast network of professionals involved, but also in the
  lasting impact created by the webinars. Through the innovative use of digital
  platforms, the ReInHerit project has fostered collaboration, knowledge
  dissemination and the creation of a network of experts that will continue to
  shape the future of the museum sector.
challengesbestpractice: "The work to research and identify the topics was
  challenging but critical to create an effective program. The preparation of
  each webinar required constant effort in managing all the  activities of the
  single sessions: trial-training sessions with speakers, collection of
  materials for publishing news and registration forms, creation of graphical
  interface of the single webinar rooms, collection of material to be
  published."
transferbestpractice: More than 250 experts were involved and participated in
  various online webinar sessions. Webinars played a crucial role in fostering
  collaboration, disseminating knowledge, and building a network of experts
  within the context of the ReInHerit project. By exploiting the potential of
  digital platforms and involving professionals from various institutions, a
  dynamic and inclusive learning environment was created. The recorded webinar
  sessions, together with the accompanying training material, will continue to
  be valuable resources for professional development in the museum sector.
