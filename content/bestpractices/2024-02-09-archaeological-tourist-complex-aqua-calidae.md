title: Archaeological tourist complex Aqua Calidae
desc: The ancient baths of Aquae calidae have reached a new stage in its
  development as a combination of digital technologies to bring back the
  glorious past and the new spa center with the famous healing water. The
  archaeological complex allows citizens and guests of Burgas to visit the fully
  renovated bathroom of Suleiman the Magnificent. Upon restoration, the original
  vision is strictly adhered, lined with marble and typical oriental ceramics.
  The authenticity is complemented by natural and artistic lightning that
  performs the act of a functioning museum where visitors can watch a movie
  based on 3D mapping. It leads the tourists to a virtual walk from the Thracian
  times and the Sacred Spring of the Three nymphs-healers through the Roman
  period, the Crusades – until the time of Suleiman the Magnificent.

  200 people have visited the place since its opening. Reaching and attracting
  new public that so far was not interested. Increasing interest of visitors to
  the site and the surrounding area.'
challengesbestpractice: Implementing digital technologies is not an easy task,
  it requires highly specialized experts and staff that needs new skills. The
  representation and transfer of cultural heritage to digital means takes time,
  the collaboration of experts from very different fields and expensive high end
  equipment.
transferbestpractice: To implement digital technologies such as VR and other
  type of visualization to transfer through time is not a new concept, but to
  combine them with direct physical experience, is not so common practice as of
  yet. Using it to extend the visitors experience is possible for most museums
  and tourist attractions, however it will require additional resources and
  funding.

The Municipality of Burgas has been continuously investing in the development of the Aquae calidae archaeological complex for more than ten years. As most large archaeological sites it requires complex approach in order to present the cultural heritage to the wide public and in the same time to preserve it. The requirements of the younger generations of tourists have changed with the digital era. Bringing technologies to experience the digital world in the same time with physical activities, has been the core idea of the project.

A new museum exposition and an active replica of a Roman bath have been built in line with the archaeological structures. The exhibition areas in the building include a training museum, a museum exposition and stock rooms. The museum exposition will exhibit archaeological finds and artifacts found during excavations in the field, now from the collection of the Regional Historical Museum - Burgas. In the training museum, visitors will have the opportunity to get acquainted with the way of life of the Romans, to soak in the baths, play games, to put on their everyday clothes or their military equipment. The exposition areas have a mixed purpose and can be used for recreational activities. The second layer is virtual and gives the opportunity to the visitors to time travel and see how the place looked like through the 20 centuries of its existence by entering a special room with 360°3D mapping. VR glasses will let the tourists enjoy the view of the old baths, learn more about the locals’ culture, while getting physically massaged. The place will continue to increase its tourist attractiveness, while preserving and promoting its cultural heritage as the technologies provide huge amount of opportunities to quick and safe extension of the services with increased added value of visitor experience.
