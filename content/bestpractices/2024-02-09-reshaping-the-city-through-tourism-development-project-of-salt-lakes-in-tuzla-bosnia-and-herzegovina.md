title: Reshaping the city through tourism development project of Salt Lakes in
  Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina
desc: "Tuzla is a city that firmly decided to position tourism as one of the
  main drivers of further development, through concrete projects that have
  transformed the image of the city. Once an industrial center is now turned
  into a significant tourist destination. This was initiated in 2003 with the
  construction of Pannonian Lakes. Salt, as a natural resource whose
  exploitation had been detrimental to the city, has been utilized as an
  advantage for further successful development. This site used to be a marshy
  area without any content or purpose, and only 20 years later, it is a popular
  touristic site. "

resourcesbestpractice: The resources that were required  for this project in all
  its phases were around 5 million EUR, and were invested from the Tuzla City
  Budget throughout the years, as the Complex of Pannonian lakes was growing and
  evolving.
successbestpractice: "\"The Pannonian Lakes Complex, as the only salt lakes in
  Europe, with its tourism activities (attractiveness, water and environmental
  cleanliness, good and affordable services, location, a large number of
  visitors) decisively influenced the decision to award the Municipality of
  Tuzla (2nd place) in the competition for the best tourist city in BiH – the
  Golden Rose for 2006, as well as the Golden Hospitality Crown Award (the
  conceptual solution of the Archaeological Park-Neolithic Sojenica
  Settlement-Pannonian Lake) in the category of special care for traditional
  cultural-historical values of BiH. Then, recognitions in the field of tourism
  for the Best Manager awarded to Mr. Majid Porobić and the Best Company in
  2012. As the culmination of 2012, the city of Tuzla and the salt lakes
  received the second prize in the 2012 UNWTO ULYSSES AWARD, the highest
  recognition of the United Nations World Tourism Organization for innovations
  in public policies and management, for the project \"\"Valorization of Natural
  Heritage – Pannonian Salt Lakes in Tuzla,\"\" awarded for innovations in the
  field of tourism. In 2013, the city of Tuzla and the Pannonian Lakes received
  the International Tourism Award GOLDEN INTERSTAS 2013 for outstanding
  contribution to the development of tourism in the city of Tuzla and a
  significant contribution to the development of tourism in Bosnia and
  Herzegovina as a whole. Also, the proof of success lies in the fact that Tuzla
  now has significant number of tourists visiting the city (around 5,5 million
  visits to the Pannonian Lakes), while 20 years ago there was close to no
  tourism traffic in Tuzla. The investment in the Pannonian Lakes project has
  completely changed the city's image and the structure of the local economy,
  with the number of available accommodation facilities in the city increasing
  by over 1000% in the past 20 years. There are multiplier effects reflected not
  only in increased sales of goods and services that tourists consume here
  during the season but also in the opening of various infrastructure and
  facilities. Since the opening of Pannonica in 2003 until today, roads have
  been constructed, water supply has been improved, lighting has been installed,
  numerous parks have been opened, city square have been inaugurated, the
  Archaeological Park has been established, and various cultural events such as
  Kaleidoscope Festival have been organized. These developments have contributed
  not only to the attractiveness of Tuzla as a destination for tourists but also
  to the quality of life for us citizens who live here."
challengesbestpractice: '"In the early stages of this project, the major
  challenge was to get the public support as most people did not believe that it
  was feasible to realize such a project in Tuzla, which back in early 2000’s
  seemed impossible. The City Administration gathered renown experts, engineers
  and technologists to prepare and design the project and also to ensure that
  the public understood the effects it will have on the entire city, without any
  risks. Later in the implementation of the project, the challenges were related
  to the technological aspects of the entire system at the lakes, which was also
  successfully ensured because special attention and care are taken in the
  maintenance (chemical and bacteriological) of the lake water through a
  specific technological process. The technological process involves 24-hour
  filtration of the total water volume of the lake (2.5 cycles) and its chemical
  treatment through a series of procedures such as maintaining pH levels,
  disinfection, algae destruction, flocculation (removal of water turbidity),
  and continuous physical cleaning of the lake complex. The most important
  segment of the technological process is water filtration, which is done
  through sand filters in two filter plants with 2.5 cycles in 24 hours for the
  total water volume. The process is automated with a constant supply of fresh
  technological water and brine. Disinfection of water, as the second most
  important process, is carried out with gaseous chlorine, and depending on
  weather conditions and the number of guests, the chlorine concentration is
  maintained at a level of 0.2-0.4 mg/l. All measurements and analyses of lake
  water (three times a week during the bathing season) are conducted at the
  Institute of Public Health of the Tuzla Canton, where all previous
  measurements have proven the absolute correctness and high quality of lake
  water during the bathing season.'
transferbestpractice: '"This project is a perfect example how any local
  community, small or big, can identify its own potential or a resource which
  makes it unique and specific and turn it into its competitive advantage.  In
  the case of Tuzla it was the salt and saline water, as a natural resource
  whose exploitation had been detrimental to the inner city core for years,
  thanks to the city administration led by the mayor of Tuzla, Mr. Jasmin
  Imamović, it has been utilized as an advantage for further successful urban
  development.  So, any local community can find its own „salt“ and transform it
  into a new tourism product that will reshape the whole community. In this
  regard, the project of Pannonian lakes in Tuzla has a great potential for
  transfer, because by identifying one strategic large-scale project of tourism
  infrastructure, the city of Tuzla has made a major positive impact on the
  quality of life in Tuzla and on local economy.  Thanks to visionary Mayor and
  cooperation and joint work of numerous experts committed to achieving success,
  any dream can be turned into reality.'
infosbestpractice: Tuzla has a special geological past. Tuzla locals say that
  Tuzla is the "city on a grain of salt." That "grain of salt" consists of
  hundreds of millions of tons of rock salt and saltwater left behind by the
  ancient Pannonian Sea, which, more than ten million years ago, retreated from
  these areas. The city's name has always, throughout its existence and in the
  languages of all travelers, cartographers, historians, conquerors, been linked
  to salt. The river Jala, flowing through Tuzla, bears a name derived from the
  Greek word "Jalos," meaning salt. Throughout its history, the city has been
  called Castron de Salenes (Greek), Salenes (Greek), Ad Salinas (Latin), Soli
  (South Slavic), Memlehatejn (Arabic), Memleha-i Zir (Persian), Tuz (Turkish)
  ... until its current name, Tuzla, which means salt pans in Turkish.

Tuzla is a city that has firmly decided to position tourism as one of the main drivers of further urban development, through concrete projects that have transformed the image of our country's industrial center into a significant tourist destination. The story of the beginnings of significant tourism development in our city began in 2003, after the construction of Phase I of the Pannonian Lakes complex, although the roots of tourism in the city of Tuzla date back to 1914 when the first Salty Spa, known in Europe for treating various rheumatic diseases, was built.
Salt, as a natural resource whose exploitation had been detrimental to the inner city core for years, thanks to the city administration led by the mayor of Tuzla, Mr. Jasmin Imamović, it has been utilized as an advantage for further successful urban development. This site used to be a marshy area without any content or purpose, and only 20 years later, it is a popular touristic site.
For the purpose of urbanization and development of this large space in the city center, the city administration came up with the idea of utilizing the natural resource in the immediate vicinity of the complex – saline water, with the aim of constructing a water reservoir in the form of a salt lake with healing properties, functioning as a city open-air bathing area. In this way, the combination of a natural resource, human ideas, and human effort created the Pannonian Lakes complex as a top-notch ecological project unique in Southeastern Europe, a project that will serve for the benefit of all citizens of Tuzla, our region, and our country. 
After the realization of Phase I of the complex's development with the construction of the large (first) lake in July 2003, stage development continued in 2006 with the construction of the Archaeological Park – Neolithic Palafitte settlement with a museum exhibition that speaks to the continuity of life in the Tuzla area from the Neolithic era. At the beginning of the summer season in 2008, the capacities of the complex were significantly increased with the construction of the second salt lake, and by the end of September, another unique tourist product was created – Salty Waterfalls, in the form of an inhalation health center in the open air, unique to these areas. The third Pannonian lake was opened on September 1, 2012.
The Pannonian Lakes complex, as the only salt lakes in Europe, has won numerous awards, with the most notable being the second prize in 2012 UNWTO ULYSSES AWARD, the highest recognition of the United Nations World Tourism Organization for innovations in public policies and management, for the project "Valorization of Natural Heritage - Pannonian Salt Lakes in Tuzla," awarded for innovations in the field of tourism. In 2013, the city of Tuzla and the Pannonian Lakes received the International Tourism Award GOLDEN INTERSTAS 2013 for outstanding contribution to the development of tourism in the city of Tuzla and a significant contribution to the development of tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole.
The current work of the Pannonian Lakes complex in Tuzla provides optimistic forecasts for future development plans. The Pannonian Lakes complex covers a total area of 75,000 m², with a shoreline length of 1,000 m and a sandy beach area of 22,000 m². Since its construction in 2003, the complex has been visited by over 5.5 million guests to date. The reasons for the high visits to the Pannonian Lakes complex undoubtedly include the absolutely pure medicinal saltwater (beneficial for bone and respiratory diseases), guest stay standards, and complex maintenance higher than the Blue Flag standards for seas and lakes (especially in the segment of guest health and safety care), good entertainment and guest animation, and very low prices for all services at the complex.
In the field of cultural tourism offerings, the Pannonica complex includes the Archaeological Park-Neolithic Palafitte settlement, a replica settlement from the Neolithic era with nine dwellings, a wooden platform, and an interior display of tools, utensils, and dishware for salt isolation. This setup testifies to the continuity of life in the Tuzla area for thousands of years. Additionally, the museum Geological Exhibition Pannonica showcases the spectacular geological history of the Tuzla area to guests.
The uniqueness of the lakes lies in the water with which they are filled, representing a combination of technological water and high-concentration brine (300 mg/l). The proportion of saltwater in the total water volume is 30%, with a salinity of 30-35 gr/l., always at the level of seawater salinity. In addition to salinity, the water of the Pannonian lake contains minerals (calcium, sodium, sulfur, iodine, bromine, etc.) and has rightfully gained the image of "medicinal" water unique in our region and in Europe.
The complex is open throughout the year for visits, walks, and recreation for citizens. It includes a modern open-air fitness center, a Street Workout Park, a giant chessboard at the first lake, and mapped walking/jogging trails around the entire complex. Adjacent to the complex is the children's amusement park "Saline Banja-Vrtić," equipped with entertainment and play facilities for children aged 3 to 12 years.
Public Utility Company "Pannonica" is active even during the winter period. The first Ice Skating Rink in Tuzla and the Tuzla Canton was opened in collaboration with the city of Tuzla in December 2006. Within the complex is a covered ice rink with an area of 660 m², with a capacity for over 100 skaters per session.
The development of this project has spurred a series of other tourist and cultural projects focused on developing additional offer in the city that meet the needs of numerous visitors and tourists. As a result, numerous festivals, entertainment and cultural programs, and events have been developed. The investment in the Pannonian Lakes project has completely changed the city's image and the structure of the local economy, with the number of available accommodation facilities in the city increasing by over 1000% in the past 20 years.
