Pafos Regional Board of Tourism (PRBT) having appraised its digital presence in several source tourism markets of Europe has identified a gap which was mainly “light” presence of the destination in the online Travel environment ( low destination awareness) thus a need to overcome this problem has arisen. Then the main stakeholders (local hoteliers), the airports operator (HERMES), the Deputy Ministry of Tourism and Hellenic Bank under the coordination of the PRBT have agreed to implement an international digital campaign. An ad hoc committee has been formed and the amount of €280,000 has been secured. Then a provider has been selected which is one of the top 10 global Travel Intent Data Providers and Platforms.

Selection of travel markets have been agreed mainly based on frequency of flights to Pafos and product match. Then KPIs have been set and campaign designs layouts and videos in three languages have been created. The campaign started in May 2021 and completed in Oct 2021.

Powered by artificial intelligence and traveller intent data, we have activated multi-channel marketing solutions to drive direct demand. The digital campaign was targeting potential travellers (B2C) with real travel intention, travellers based on interest and travel behaviour as well as travellers based on location.

Similar digital campaign for the period May-Nov 2022 is currently under implementation to create more awareness about the Pafos regions as a smart cultural tourism destination.
