resourcesbestpractice: "The project in Janus Pannonius Museum was funded by
  Ágoston Kubinyi Program. The aim of the tender: provide a central budget
  source for the professional support of municipally maintained museum
  institutions. Usually this kind of digital development costs approximately
  from 23 000 EUR."
successbestpractice: "The first DiVit digital sand table was established in Papa
  in 2016. After Papa’s Esterhazy-castle success this new wave of Museum
  Pedagogy started to get popularity: now there are 8 places in Hungary where
  the institute uses DiVit to attract tourists to the Museums visit and enjoy
  the exhibitions. Co-creation stands in the synergy of different kind of
  institutes and the CCI’s diversity. This exemplification gave new life of
  cultural heritages."

transferbestpractice: "CCT faces the problem that it is difficult to arouse the
  interest of the new generation. New Museum Pedagogical directions must be
  invented by CCI’s provided solutions (digital products, software, toys&game,
  VR/AR). Developments must be in line with modern trends, digital education to
  activate the young. DiVit give this by flexibility to learn playful:
  exhibitions can step to the next level with spectacular interactive content
  brought to the users by terminals, mobile applications, VR glasses or mixed
  reality installations. This kind of support makes possible to the local CCT to
  increase the number of visitors and in that way the income generating by
  selling tickets. Implementation of digital solutions in tourism sector is
  necessarily nowadays. Multimedia touchscreens and sand tables can be
  implemented in several institutes (libraries, museums, cultural heritages)
  with several topics from mining through battles to wineries etc."

Renovated Mecsek Mining Exhibition at Janus Pannonius Museum in Pécs, where two touch screen terminals located in the refurbished exhibition spaces feature DiVit experience terminal system. This is remembering the coal and uranium mining, an industry that has ceased to exist. DiVit helps the Museum Pedagogy from 2018 in two touchscreen terminals: with the help of spectacular animations visitors learn about the construction of mines and excavations, the dangers of mines and the defences against them, as well as listen to the miner's recollections and stories. The theme of the horizontal giant touch screen terminal is on the one hand a map-based presentation of the Mecsek mining sites illustrated with photos and descriptions, and on the other hand a description of the formation and use of coal and uranium with the help of interactive 3-dimensional models. And the most popular content is an interactive game in which players can compete with each other to try out the barren sorting process.

DiVit gave a new image to the old museum, modernized it’s services. TourInform offices promoted it, which caused the increasing number of visitors.
