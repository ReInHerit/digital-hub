resourcesbestpractice: Financial resources allocated by the ReInHerit budget of
  the Blue Shield. Human resources relying on the staff involved in the project
  as well as expertise both of the staff and the Scientific Committee involved
  in the organisation of the conference.
successbestpractice: First and foremost, our Committee achieved to engage policy
  makers and cultural heritage professionals so as to inform, influence, impact
  and embed robust evidence-based policymaking in the ReInHerit project results;
  that is the ReInHerit toolkit and the Digital Hub. To this end, our Committee
  engaged a variety of stakeholders including Universities and research
  institutes, Ministries of Culture and Sports, Education, Foreign Affairs, and
  civil society organisations such as Blue Shield International. The topics were
  proposed in close collaboration with the coordinator and the members of the
  consortium cover the thematic axes of the ReInHeRit project, and they can have
  an impact both in terms of dissemination of the scientific results of the
  project and to gain valuable feedback from participants and various audiences
  in view of a broader strategy to inform public opinion. Οur committee provides
  expertise, capacity and knowledge in the domain of cultural heritage and is an
  agent of representativity, mutual understanding and consensus. Therefore, we
  contributed to achieving the ReInHerit project's policy objectives in line
  with Blue Shield international goals and statutes.
challengesbestpractice: The challenges encountered relate mainly to the
  post-conference survey participation. Low participation and restricted
  geographical dispersion could mean that the results of the survey are not
  representative of all the countries participating in the project. The
  challenge was to motivate partners to disseminate the survey.
transferbestpractice: The policy recommendations and the survey results can help
  draw conclusions on what policies should be implemented to address the
  challenges CH professionals are facing at an EU level and increase visibility
  of the project.

Important steps and recommendations for regulating GenAI based on a human-centered approach include concerns related to the Ethics of AI Chatbots, user privacy policy compliance, training data, and the scientific accuracy of chatbot outputs. The development of artificial intelligence applications involved extensive training on datasets. Ensuring that the final training data is ethically sourced, unbiased, and devoid of discriminatory content is crucial for maintaining the ethical integrity of AI tools. 

_Training data: AI applications involved extensive training on large data sets. It is crucial to ensure that the final training is ethically sourced and respect the privacy of users.
_Transparency: Chatbot must be transparent about how the data is used and ensure that the data is stored securely and, where appropriate, anonymised.
_Scientific accuracy: Chatbot responses must be tested and validated by museums. This is especially important for applications that provide historical or scientific information to museum visitors through solutions that avoid AI “hallucinations”.

The ReInHerit project created Ethics Cards for the developed applications, considering fairness and all the ethical issues associated with a user-centered approach with AI/CV. These cards analyse different aspects of the applications such as Training Data (Dataset and Model cards used, bias discrimations) User Data (user data collection, privacy, transparency, use Third part…) Data Security (data protection, cyber-attacks) Copyright aspects (copyright for the training data)

To guarantee quality content, the descriptions of the artworks accessible to visitors during the Smart Interaction and the data used by the Chatbot have been provided by by the Museums involved in the ReinHerit Project (GrazMuseum, Cycladic Museum, Bank of Cyprus Foundation) The content used by the chatbot is provided by curators using a specific interface. System do not rely on something “memorized” by the chatbot. The questions of the users are encapsulated in other instructions (prompt engineering) that instruct the chatbot to answer only using the curated material.
