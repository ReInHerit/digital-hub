  incentives) and policies of the ministry of the interior. At the same time, it
  cultivates urban consciousness and urban aesthetics. The success of the
  Festival is also proven by the high level of attendance, as approximately

transferbestpractice: The “festivalization” of the CIs is a fundamental and
  efficient way of developing Cultural Creative Tourism. During a festival,
  creative actors can be gathered together and coherently presented to
  particular target groups archiving promotion, networking and strengthening of
  cultural industries which are fundamental priorities for further development
  of both CCIs and the city. Key success factors are the improvement of
  corporate sponsorship whilst enhancing strong collaboration with private
  organisations. Other key success factors include the promotion of cultural and
  creative production, diversification of activities, and amelioration of
  accessibility. The festival had been a precursor of the Nicosia’s “Creative
  Business Quarter” strategic plan and a catalyst for upgrading municipal plans
  of urban revitalization, enrichment of cultural policies and improvement of
  urban mobility plans.

During the financial crisis in Cyprus creative actors had been neglected, urban degradation was noted and tourists were experiencing Nicosia's stagnation. Responding to this situation, NiMAC (Nicosia Municipal Arts Centre) took the initiative to mobilize and motivate Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs). Through the review and redefinition of their role, CCIs would be able to contribute to the growth of a new economic model through the renewing of urban space and the re-mobilization of tourists’ interest. 

An average of 30 unexploited shops are being renovated and rented to creative actors in low costs, for 6 weeks. Shops are located within a degraded urban district. Through an open call, NiMAC chooses the most relevant proposals to the 4th content pillars: innovation, trade, culture/arts and education. Additionally, NiMAC has the responsibility of implementing the marketing plan for promoting actors, events and the festival. Also, more than 20 special events are organised hosting cultural and creative shows, exhibitions, installations, open-air music events, lectures and workshops, the festival fosters, grassroots networking, cooperation, interaction, encouragement of synergies and stimulation for innovative and prototype artistic production.

An outstanding example of a CCIs festival that is re-shaping an area’s image and develop Creative Tourism. Creative artists, locals and tourists are interacting and co-producing new forms of cultural products having a sustainable social and economic impact.
