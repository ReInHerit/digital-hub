transferbestpractice: This report could constitute a guide on how to develop an
  E- shop. It documents the development of the ReInHerit E-shop including the
  ‘how to’ process. This could enable other small and mid-sized museums to
  understand and develop their own E-shop responding, thus, to social
  imperatives combined with financial pressure such as growth of companies and
  raise of entrepreneurial initiatives.

Taking into account the primary and secondary research, the consortium agreed to create printable digital items instead of tangible objects, responding thus to the need for museums to demonstrate environmental sustainability by making effective and balanced use of their resources through digital needs. This means that the users could download and print in 2D or 3D these digital items that will be available for free through the digital hub. The E-shop presentation has been agreed upon with UniGraz (WP4 leader) and BOCCF (during meetings through M8-10). At the same time, the three partner-museums proposed some of their artefacts to serve as the inspiration for the E-shop products.

All the digital objects in the ReInHerit eShop are free to download.
