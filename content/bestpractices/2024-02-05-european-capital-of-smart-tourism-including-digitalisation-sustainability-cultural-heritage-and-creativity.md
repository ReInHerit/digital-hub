timebestpractice: June 2022 - December 2023
resourcesbestpractice: All involved stakeholders including local authorities,

  and the Pafos Regional Board of Tourism where since 2016 have invested
  hundreds of thousands euro, human resource, Natural resources, resources

successbestpractice: Pafos (Cyprus) and Seville (Spain) were selected as the
  winners of the 2023 European Capital of Smart Tourism, following a European
  Jury meeting in Brussels on 9 November 2022.
challengesbestpractice: Pafos Region is a relatively small area and all
  resources are limited, thus the only way forward was to act smarter.  A great
  effort was placed to ensure that the City, the residents, businesses, and
  others are dedicated to smartness and sustainability. By nature people are
  resistant to changes, so a great effort was placed for citizens and
  stakeholders to convince them about the plan to accept the new way
  of  thinking. Human resources with expertise in all four themes
  sustainability, accessibility, digitalization and cultural heritage creativity
  was not widely available. Securing financial resources was also a great
  challenge since money was not easily or readily available to implement
  projects. Be flexible and align on the team vision and goal. Keep up team
  engagement. In an era with fast changing travelling habits, emerging
  technologies and rational climate changes, a set of new challenges faced and
  had to adjust the initial plans and adapt to the new needs. In addition to the
  above, the collection of data for creating this digital database was a
  significant challenge as well as overcoming the restrictions and legislations
  from municipalities and councils. Last but not least had to face communication
  breakdowns, conflicts, lack of trust sometimes and difficulties in integrating
  diverse perspectives. However with effective leadership by the Mayor and the
  Tourism Board and open communication have managed to overcome these
  challenges.
transferbestpractice: "The key Good Practice features to share and transfer
  are:  -Have a plan, the commitment of residents, local authorities,
  stakeholders and others, secure resources and show willingness to change
  things -Sustainability: Recognise that we are part of problem and part of the
  solution and actively provide solutions -Accessibility: Adopt the moto, every
  single thing accessible to every single person and become more and more
  accessible every day  -Digitalisation: Great success for Pafos was the change
  in the way we think! Digital Transformation Journey should accelerate.
  Introduce new initiatives and lead the way for more successful
  stories   -Cultural Heritage and Creativity: Our slogan is Bridging
  Continents, Linking Cultures. Safeguarding and sharing culture, enhance local
  and European cultural heritage through a number of policies and programmes. To
  potential organisations that should have to act as a role model we recommend:
  -Have an innovative mechanism for collaboration, sharing values, and the
  ability to overcome obstacles.  -Set clear values which are accepted from all
  involved parties. -Present passion, trust and ability to inspire.
  -Demonstrating commitment to goals and willingness to invest the necessary
  resources to achieve success. -Past and present successful initiatives and
  stories must share. All of the above contributes towards a smarter tourism,
  smarter destinations!"

The city then offers a new experience to visitors with the possibility – coming soon – to download the Myth of Aphrodite app for free, after the success of the pilot project using AR (Augmented Reality). Users will be able to scan relevant photos of Aphrodite in three different places on the beach, to enjoy Aphrodite in a real environment through their smart devices. The scenes include the mythical goddess emerging from the foam of the sea, sitting on a rock, and reading a book on the beach. Users can then interact, and find information on the app, with locations and description. Culture lovers or explorers, all can download the app and enjoy it.
