challengesbestpractice: Pafos Region is a small area and all resources are
  limited thus the only way forward was to act SMARTER.  We had to place a great
  effort  to ensure that the City, the residents, businesses, and others are
  dedicated  to smartness and sustainability. By nature people is resistant to
  changes  so we have placed a great effort for citizens and  stakeholders to
  convince them of our plan accept the new way of  thinking.   Human resource
  with expertise in all four themes sustainability, accessibility,
  digitalization and cultural heritage creative tourism was not widely
  available. Securing financial resources was also a great challenge since money
  was not easily or readily available to implement projects.        Be flexible
  and align on the team vision and goal. Keep up team engagement. In an era with
  fast changing travelling habits, emerging technologies and rational climate
  changes we have faced a set of new challenges and we had to adjust our initial
  plans and adapt to the new needs  In addition to the above, the collection of
  data for creating this digital database was a significant challenge as well as
  overcoming the restrictions and legislations from municipalities and councils
  Last but not least we had to face communication breakdowns, conflicts, lack of
  trust sometimes and difficulties in integrating diverse perspectives.  However
  with effective leadership by the mayor and the tourism board and open
  communication we have managed to overcoming these challenges.

infosbestpractice: Since the above synergy proved very successful we have
  decided to expand further the project/synergy  by enlarging the experiences
  offered.  The Laona plateau is famous for its white grape varieties, mainly
  the native Xynisteri but also Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Muscat. It also
  produces beautiful red varieties such as Maratheftiko, Cabernet Sauvignon,
  Shiraz and Merlot and others. The Laona wineries are famous for the excellent
  wine produced . With the above in mind the initiative will be enriching with
  visits to the vineyards and local wineries with the aim to further enhance
  sustainable cultural tourism.
