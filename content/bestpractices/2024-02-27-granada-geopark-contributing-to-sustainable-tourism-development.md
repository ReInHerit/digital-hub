desc: In the province of Granada there is a territory with a spectacular
  landscape and one of the best continental geological records of the last 5
  million years. Among other treasures, this record contains the most complete
  set of fossil remains of the now extinct large mammals that lived during the
  Quaternary Period (the last 2.5 million years of the Earth’s history, when
  humanity appeared on the planet).

  participatory bottom up strategy. It is also important that public
  administration involves in it to obtain its support through grants and its
  understanding on the protection of local heritage. It generates pride of its
  heritage and culture among local population; it is the main element to build a
  “product” for the long term in every territory.

In the **province of Granada** there is a territory with a spectacular landscape and **one of the best continental geological records of the last 5 million years.** Among other treasures, this record contains the most complete set of fossil remains of the now extinct large mammals that lived **during the Quaternary Period** (the last 2.5 million years of the Earth’s history, when humanity appeared on the planet).

The territory of the Granada Geopark, with **4,722 km2 and 47 municipalities** belonging to the districts of Guadix, Baza, Huéscar and Montes, includes the current river valleys generated during the Quaternary in the north of the province of Granada, as well as much of the Guadix-Baza basin and part of the mountains that delimit it. This territory has traditionally been known, from a geographical point of view, as the depressions or hoyas of Guadix and Baza. Its unique geological features supplement elements not included in other UNESCO Global Geoparks.

**Since the UNESCO Global Geopark declaration** was obtained **(on 10 July 2020)**, through the International Geoscience and Geoparks programme, this territory – and especially its people – have had a unique opportunity to mitigate the constant depopulation process to which it is subject, as well as to raise public awareness of the importance of the natural, cultural and ethnographic heritage, all with a responsible attitude to the environment.

Granada Geopark is an initiative based on a relevant geological heritage and other natural and cultural resources located in the north area of Granada where the depopulation is a deep problem. It is an important tool for local population since it allows them to discover its potential, new professional opportunities and the pride of belonging to a territory where history has left its mark. It focuses on a bottom up development strategy implemented by Local Action Groups guaranteeing an active participation of all the social and economic sectors and the involvement of the Public Institutions as well.

The strategy is based on three pillars:

• Education: Actions aimed at scholars and university students and educational programme focused on geological values, biodiversity and natural heritage for school teachers. It also organises complementary and promotional activities, highlighting those concerning the different forms of housing (cave-houses), landscape and natural photography courses and technical seminars on geological heritage and geotourism.\
• Research and divulgation: Organising guided visits to interpretation centres and small museums. Involvement of the scientific community.\
• Sustainable Tourism: Valorisation of local products, traditions, natural and cultural touristic resources, creation of new business opportunities. The territory contains small museums and interpretation centres that carry out research, conservation, dissemination and teaching.

## Expert opinion of Interreg Europe Policy Learning Platform

Geoparks are an excellent way of triggering local economic development in a very sustainable way. Geoparks also strengthen the local identity and the link to nature. The initiative has become so successful globally that, since 2015, there has been the UNESCO global geopark label. Regions across Europe could explore the positive impacts of this practice and could decide to valorise existing geological heritage on their territories.
