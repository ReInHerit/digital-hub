title: Via Mariae - the spiritual pilgrimage route
desc: '"The Via Maria pilgrimage route is a spiritual tourist road,which is
  based on the veneration of Saint Mary by the peoples, but also unites the
  Marian places and the historical and cultural values found along the route,
  without distinguishing religion. It aims to build in Central Europe a network
  that systematizes the religious values of this region, it  connects in the
  east-west direction  and in the north-south direction. The road traces a cross
  on the map of Central Europe (Austria, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Poland,
  Croatia, Bosnia), thus creating a network of pilgrimage routes based on local
  values.'

infosbestpractice: The main Via Mariae routes start from Mariazell in Austria
  and go to Şumuleu Ciuc. They do not end here, they cross the Eastern
  Carpathians and continue in Bucovina and Moldova. The terminal points at the
  moment are in Putna and Iasi. Starting from Harghita county, Via Mariae goes
  together with the thematic road Via Transilvanica.  The network of pilgrimage
  roads in Cluj county consists of two main routes and several secondary routes.
  Route M05 marked with purple color enters the county at Aghires, and exits at
  Năoiu. The M01 route marked in red enters the county at Ašchileul Mic, passes
  north of Cluj, reaches the Nicula monastery, then joins the M05 route.  In
  addition to these main routes, secondary routes are alternatives. They touch
  other localities and are of different degrees of difficulty. To cover the
  distance Cluj Nicula we have several alternatives. We can go on the route
  Cojocna, Sic Nicula. Another option is via Borşa, Bonţida, Sic. Another option
  is via Răscruci, Gherla. The third option is via Apahida, Juc, Bonţida, Sic.
  These alternative routes can be combined according to everyone's liking.
  Circuits can also be made. It is good to choose the optimal option depending
  on interest, physical condition, time available.

Via Mariae – the last 100 km was built in a partnership by Harghita County Council, Transylvanian Way of Mary Organization, Harghita Community Development Association, local municipalities and associations. 

The 6,500 euro project (building of the routes, pilgrimage insignias, certificates and passports, promotional materials, event organization etc.) budget was funded by partners. The 100 kilometres pilgrimage route is available on foot, bicycle and horse. Pilgrims can experience a lifelong adventure with the possibility of learning about local history and attractions, and also which will help them not only to get closer to the environment but to prove their own physical and mental perseverance. 

The www.100km.mariaut.ro website contributes to a calm and meaningful pilgrimage, including accommodations, attractions, shops, cafes, pharmacies, health centers, police stations, and other important locations. Local contacts are available in each settlement to support pilgrims.
This road addresses everyone, it calls everyone. 

They are waiting for those who, regardless of nationality, religion, want to be pilgrims for religious, spiritual, self-knowledge purposes and they are also waiting for those who want to step on this road for now only for touristic or sports purposes. This road will be a bridge between nations, religions, people, connecting the west to the east, thus becoming the Road Connecting the Nations of Central and Eastern Europe, the "Road of Reconciliation", which in the future can become a European cultural road.

The road is divided  in 7 sections, each section is described according with all information that it is needed.
