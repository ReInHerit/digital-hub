transferbestpractice: The Guimarares CdM experience has excellent potential for
  both learning and transfer by other similar cities that wish to show their
  heritage to visitors in an original interpretation way. This includes
  preservation in various archives, libraries and museums, there are several
  depictions – and motivations – that convey the perception and memory of a land
  area over time. From the documents that establish laws and set standards, such
  as a Charter or a UNESCO’s recognition of the Historic Quarter, to the
  conveying of a certain point of view through films or photographs, or even to
  personal notes kept in a diary or in an artistic drawing, by way of stories
  forbidden by censorship, many are the stories and the memories kept by
  Guimarães, and which are kept with regard to Guimarães.  The CdM has already
  inspired CHRISTA project partners in their action plans and policy instrument
  improvements in terms of heritage interpretation and sustainable cultural
  tourism development and promotion.

The Casa da Memória of Guimarães is a center of interpretation and knowledge that exposes, through the exhibition Territory and Community, various perspectives of the memory of a place. Located in the old plastic factory Pátria, in Av. Conde Margaride, is a place where citizens of Guimarães share and reflect on their roots, traditions and memories. Casa da Memória brings together a set of stories, documents, facts and objects enabling us to get to know different aspects of the community from Prehistory to the Dawn of Portugal’s Nationhood, from Rural Societies and Festivities to the Industrialization of the Ave River Valley and Contemporary Times.

Casa da Memória is located in a former industrial facility which housed the Fábrica de Plásticos Pátria (plastics factory), a Guimarães-based industry with tradition in the manufacture of combs, hairpins, headbands and other plastic objects, such as small toys and household items. Architects Miguel P. Guedes de Carvalho and José Carlos Melo Dias were entrusted with the old Fábrica Pátria building’s remodeling project design, which was aimed at transforming the venue to Casa da Memória. The industrial ruins were adapted to a new use, considering that the building’s architecture contains the site’s historical memory, which must be preserved.

Through the several maps of the land area of Guimarães, shown in the exhibition Territory and Community, the visitors can see how Guimarães has been built up over the centuries.

## Expert opinion of Interreg Europe Policy Learning Platform

This is a positive example of valorization of a cultural heritage asset that after its transformation offers original interpretation of heritage and thus enhances visitors’ experience. The practice can serve as an inspiration for other cities motivated to conserve and valorize their cultural heritage assets and present their heritage to visitors in an original way.
