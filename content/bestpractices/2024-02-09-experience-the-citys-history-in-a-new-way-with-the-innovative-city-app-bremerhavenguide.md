title: Experience the city's history in a new way with the innovative city app
  "BremerhavenGuide"
desc: The "BremerhavenGuide" is a free app that brings the maritime cultural
  heritage of the city of Bremerhaven to life in an innovative and emotional
  way. The Bremerhaven APP developed by Erlebnis Bremerhaven Ltd. and the
  Department of Economics, Tourism and Science presents points of interest
  (sights, historical sites and attractions), a digital city map and interactive
  city tours. Users can call up individually selected points of interest (POIs)
  with the app and start themed guided tours of the city. The POIs are presented
  using informative and entertaining videos, audio stories, images and texts.
  The city can be experienced interactively at selected POIs through the
  implementation of augmented reality (AR) technology.

resourcesbestpractice: Human and financial resources were required to develop
  the BremerhavenGuide app. However, scientific expertise was also required for
  the development of the APP and the integration of the innovative AR
  technology. In order to design a prototype and explore the various
  possibilities offered by the complex AR technology in the context of the APP,
  the Department of Economics, Tourism and Science, together with Erlebnis
  Bremerhaven, initiated a student project at Bremerhaven University of Applied
  Sciences in the Computer Science programme. The results of the project work
  served as the basis for the description of the rough concept and the
  definition of work packages, among other things.
successbestpractice: From the City of Bremerhaven's perspective, the
  BremerhavenGuide application is a successful medium for innovative
  communication of the city's history and culture. The combination of
  interactive map, virtual tours, use of AR technology and special city
  information results in a unique selling point of the application that makes
  the BremerhavenGuide attractive to use. The success of the application is
  reflected in the number of downloads. The BremerhavenGuide is available in the
  Google Play Store and the App Store. In both stores, the application achieves
  a large number of downloads and good user ratings.   The reports in the public
  media such as regional daily newspapers, radio reports and posts in the social
  media also reflect the positive evaluation by the public.  The impact of the
  application was also examined in a master's thesis at Bremerhaven University
  of Applied Sciences in the ""Digitalisation, Innovation and Information
  Management"" course. The evaluation of the BremerhavenGuide was analysed under
  various aspects using a survey. The evaluation of the survey shows that the
  BremerhavenGuide is accepted by people of all ages and that the respondents
  rate the presentation of the city's history and culture using the application
  and AR technology as attractive.
challengesbestpractice: The first step was to define and establish the structure
  and features of the mobile application to be developed. A joint workshop was
  held with the client (Erlebnis Bremerhaven) and the commissioned IT agency to
  complete this task, taking into account the technical feasibility. Together,
  key elements of the application such as the cloud database, CMS system,
  interactive elements and app-compliant operating concept as well as intuitive
  use were defined.   During the implementation of the new design and functional
  concept, however, sources of error arose that could not have been foreseen
  during the conceptualisation phase. An error management system was integrated
  so that these sources of error could be identified quickly and the application
  could be improved and optimised accordingly.  Creating complete accessibility
  for the app is currently an unresolved challenge, as screen reader and
  keyboard use is not possible in the app. Solution structures are currently
  being developed and will be implemented in the near future.  A further
  challenge was compliance with the legal framework provided by the General Data
  Protection Regulation. The application could only be implemented under the
  premise of compliance with the regulation. In addition to the technical and
  legal challenges, the development of the app also raised the question of the
  acceptance of AR technology. How will the technology be accepted in the newly
  developed app? What reservations exist regarding the communication of
  information through the use of AR technology? To answer these questions, the
  questions were examined as part of a master's thesis at Bremerhaven University
  of Applied Sciences in the "Digitalisation, Innovation and Information
  Management" course. The findings and recommendations derived from the master's
  thesis were taken into account in the further development of the APP.
transferbestpractice: '"The potential for transferring the application is very
  high, as the commissioned agency has developed a general functional concept as
  the basis for the BremerhavenGuide. This concept can be configured according
  to the individual needs and wishes of other cities. As the use of applications
  is becoming increasingly popular and the trend is being taken up by more and
  more cities and local authorities, there is also a need for corresponding
  service models for the development of city applications. The potential for
  transferability of the functional concept developed for the BremerhavenGuide
  as well as the increased demand is also reflected in the economic utilisation
  of the developed structures. The agency commissioned with the implementation
  of the application offers the generalised concept as an offer model on the
  website https://cityar.de/#featureInfo. The basic application can be
  configured in different ways by customers and customised to suit individual
  circumstances.  Following the publication of the BremerhavenGuide, the City of
  Bremen promptly published a corresponding application under the name
  ""BremenGo"". The design and structure correspond to the BremerhavenGuide. The
  applications differ only in their city-specific content.'
infosbestpractice: "\"Through the CMS system anchored at the tourism company,
  further content can be added to the BremerhavenGuide by the user. Since the
  launch of the application, further tours have been added that present both the
  history of the city and its identity. The following tours were developed under
  the premise of the individual characteristics of the city of Bremerhaven -
  fish, harbour and science city:  Fishing Harbour Tour: On this tour, you can
  experience many interesting facts about fish from the past and present at 23
  different locations.  EnergieKlimaTour: The EnergieKlima Tour shows the many
  facets of climate protection at 10 different locations - innovative research,
  concrete applications and good examples.  A \"\"wheelchair tour\"\" has been
  developed to fulfil the city of Bremerhaven's goal of participation for all.
  The tour has been developed for anyone travelling on wheels, with a
  wheelchair, rollator or pushchair or those with limited mobility.  Other
  identification-creating tours, such as a tour to the museum ships, are
  currently being realised. A tour on the topic of sustainability will be
  developed in spring 2024."

With the BremerhavenGuide app, users can go on a historical and cultural journey of discovery and experience places of culture and history, sights, insider places and scientific and tourist facilities. The BremerhavenGuide offers an interactive, digital city map in which various themed tours can be started, such as the historical tour "Experience a journey through time in Bremerhaven". The digital tour of the city's history takes you to interesting sights and historical locations. From the oldest active lighthouse on the German North Sea coast to the Historical Museum, the Emigration Monument and the historic bascule bridge. The app uses videos, audio stories, images and texts to provide entertaining information at a total of 20 stations.  At some "Points of Interest" (PoI), a very special information experience awaits the user. Whenever the word "Augmented Reality" (AR) is displayed on a PoI page, you can use your smartphone to explore unexpected insights, entertaining visualisations or exciting all-round views. AR technology offers users an enhanced city experience by merging the real environment with virtual elements. Virtual reality glasses are not required for the interactive city experience. The user only needs an AR-capable smartphone or tablet to play the AR scenes. The interactive experiences, which conventional sources of information cannot reproduce, evoke positive emotional reactions in the viewer (wow effect), which also contribute to an improved perception of the historical sites and cultural assets. The innovative storytelling, such as fascinating 360-degree views and the integration of numerous playful elements and activities, motivates users even more to engage with the city's historical sites and sights and also creates positive experiences.

The BremerhavenGuide is innovative from a technical and conceptual point of view and was designed as a virtual interface to the city society and local tourists and all interested parties as a tourism and city marketing tool. The user does not have to be on site to access the app content. The location-independent use of the information at any time enables greater and flexible dissemination of cultural and historical content. In addition, new digital contact points are created to address locals, future guests and interested parties.

Conceptually, the APP was conceived and designed from the user application. The clear and well-organised architecture of the app ensures a high level of user quality. In order to fulfil the different requirements of the users, the APP can be set to either English or German. The text size can also be customised. Frequently asked questions are answered under the "Info" tab and allow feedback to be sent.

The BremerhavenGuide was developed under the premise of sustainability. The dimension of social sustainability was taken into account in several respects. On the one hand, the cultural assets relevant to Bremerhaven, such as the historic bascule bridge at the New Harbour, the Simon-Loschen lighthouses and the rear light in the Fishery Harbour showcase and the converted historic fish station in the Fishery Harbour showcase, are presented in detail in the app. The city's cultural heritage is brought to life for visitors through innovative storytelling and promotes regional identity. 
The fascinating 360-degree views and AR elements make it possible to experience places such as historic ships that are difficult to make accessible to people with physical disabilities.
AR technology also makes it possible to experience historical sites and sights that are not open to the public, offering users unique experiences. Among other things, the BremerhavenGuide enables a spectacular view from the Oberfeuer lighthouse, which is otherwise only accessible to the relevant personnel. The implementation of wind noises makes the scene even more authentic for the viewer.

With the BremerhavenGuide, the city of Bremerhaven wants to generate a wide reach and visibility for the historical and touristically relevant PoI in Bremerhaven. The BremerhavenGuide is also intended to attract new target groups such as young people with an affinity for mobile phones. The APP is intended to draw the attention of the city's society, tourists and interested parties to the tourism-related institutions of knowledge transfer, such as the German Maritime Museum - Leibnitz Institute of Maritime History and the German Emigration Centre, so that the exciting and informative offers of these institutions are used even more. To this end, the APP was designed in such a way that the respective digital tour can be interrupted at any time and the user can decide on the city experience themselves. The personalised use of the APP meets the user's need for individuality and enables the use of further information services on site at any time. To help users find their way around the city, their own location and the routes to the PoI locations are displayed on the city map. The app thus helps to make the historical and cultural sites that can be found throughout the city more visible to the user.

The content of the APP is created and managed via a content management system, which is located at Erlebnis Bremerhaven. As the tourism company (Erlebnis Bremerhaven) has direct access to the content of the APP, the BremerhavenGuide can be maintained and expanded by its own employees. The content does not become outdated and there is a sufficient degree of flexibility in the management of the BremerhavenGuide. An IT service provider only needs to be utilised for the development of AR scenes. The technical feasibility of the app is regularly monitored and adapted to the technical development of smartphone technology.

The presentation of the historical and cultural sites by the BremerhavenGuide provides digital rather than physical information. By dispensing with printed advertising media, natural resources are conserved and an active contribution is made to greater climate protection.
