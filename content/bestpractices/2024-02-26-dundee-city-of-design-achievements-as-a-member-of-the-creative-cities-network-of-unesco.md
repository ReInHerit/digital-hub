## Expert opinion - Interreg Europe Policy Learning Platform

This good practice highlights the potential and importance of integrating design and creative industries – crafts & folk arts, media arts, film, design, gastronomy, literature and music, etc. – into plans for urban and regional development. At the city level, Dundee shows the positive results that can come from branding themselves as a creative, cultural centre. Such activities have shown to amplify the activities of local craftsman and artisans to a wider (national and international) audience. In the case of Dundee, this has led to growth and development in the CCI and CCT industries as well as attracting visitors to the city through art and creative festivals. In addition to boasting a robust cultural and creative sector, Dundee is also included in the UNESCO Creative Cities network which helps to further promote themselves and their local artisans.
