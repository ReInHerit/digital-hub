desc: This is an innovative and creative project as it reveals a different type
  of an exhibition and a new way of approaching visitors. The stories the
  tourists can listen in their VR headsets are personally addresses, the
  tourists become part of that story, of a play or film. ASTRA VR is an
  emotional and sentimental story, a live representation of the daily life in a
  village.

transferbestpractice: The success of this project demonstrates that it can
  become a good practice example for other similar museum or cultural
  institutions. The ASTRA VR project has helped the organizers to get some
  important results. They managed to bring to light the patrimony in the museum
  through a modern design with new techniques which attract especially young
  people, children, and teenagers. The good results and the number of visitors
  should encourage other cultural institutions or museums to implement such a
  project and apply modern technology. The main goal of the project was to
  promote ethnography and museum heritage with the help of innovation. Such a
  project not only that will help a better promotion of the site but will
  increase people awareness for patrimony. The museum becomes an interactive,
  dynamic place of knowledge. Such a project could be a premiere for any
  open-air museum/ exhibition. It will enable tourists to get information in a
  fun and entertaining way.

It is a 3D animated world which shows various life events, landscape, nature, architecture, and local customs.

The idea of this project came in the context of the international trends in digitalizing tourism and various travel sectors. The Sars-Cov2 pandemic fastened and supported even more these trends. More than one year of lockdown and curfew triggered a huge need for the multimedia technology and virtual tours.

The Astra Open Air Museum in Sibiu sensed this need and took it as an opportunity. The applied for an EEA Grants project and received funds to implement the VR project. The main goal was to create a connection between the archaic rural life still present in many parts of Romania and the new technologized world. Thus, through this project the ASTRA Museum creates and amazing bond between two different types of worlds and facilitates the access of the community towards patrimony and heritage.

This is an innovative and creative project as it reveals a different type of an exhibition and a new way of approaching visitors. The stories the tourists can listen in their VR headsets are personally addresses, the tourists become part of that story, of a play or film. ASTRA VR is an emotional and sentimental story, a live representation of the daily life in a village.

The main stakeholder is the ASTRA Open Air Museum and this project is dedicated to all the tourists who visit it.



## Expert opinion of Interreg Europe Policy Learning Platform

Europe’s cultural heritage is as rich and diverse as are its member states. It comprises archaeological sites, museums, monuments, artworks, historic cities, literary and musical work, and is an important element of social life, as well as economic development. The recent COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted access to heritage, leading to increased interest in sites that could be accessed digitally. According to the UNESCO’s Charter on the Preservation of the Digital Heritage, digitalisation helps to preserve heritage for the future and allows it to be accessed in any part of the world. Unprecedented opportunities enabled by technologies bring cultural heritage sites back to life. The sector’s transformation has led to easier online access to cultural material for everybody. This good practice is an excellent example of the use of digitalisation, specifically virtual reality, through which visitors can experience historical events, landscape, nature, architecture, and local customs. The good practice can easily be replicated and transferred to other regions in Europe.
