resourcesbestpractice: As an interactive exhibition area for climate zones, the
  Exhibition requires an efficient resource infrastructure. The physical
  structure ensures climate control through special construction methods and
  materials. The energy supply combines renewable and conventional sources with
  energy-saving technologies. The heating, ventilation and air conditioning
  system are central. Interactive displays,multimedia presentation technologies
  realize the exhibition contents. Sustainable water management, waste reduction
  and recycling are integrated. The qualified staff and financial resources,
  including construction and operating costs, are in place. Visitor interaction,
  security and comprehensive sustainability considerations are key elements.
  Identified challenges are addressed to position as a sustainable, interactive
  and informative facility.
successbestpractice: The success of the Climate House lies in education and
  information about climate change, based on scientific findings. It acts as a
  tourist attraction, promotes educational programs, emphasizes sustainability
  aspects and supports international cooperation in the fight against climate
  change. Overall, it helps raise awareness, promote education and inspire
  positive change for the environment and sustainability. In 2022, the Klimahaus
  received the “National Prize – Education for Sustainable Development” from the
  Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German UNESCO Commission.
  In the “Learning Places” category, the Klimahaus received the award for its
  diverse and creative integration of education for sustainable development.
challengesbestpractice: The Climate House faces various challenges that impact
  both operations and educational goals. A key challenge is securing sufficient
  financial resources for the ongoing operation and further development of the
  exhibition. The timeliness and relevance of the information provided about
  climate change requires continuous adaptation to the latest scientific
  research. Long-term visitor interest and retention are central to the success
  of the Climate House and require the continuous development of engaging
  programs and activities. Clearly communicating complex climate issues to
  visitors of different age groups represents another challenge. In addition, as
  an environmental protection facility, the Climate House itself must implement
  sustainable practices, from energy supply to waste disposal. The integration
  of new technologies and adaptation to technological change are also important
  in order to maintain the climate house's ability to innovate. Successfully
  addressing these challenges requires a holistic and coordinated approach,
  involving various disciplines and interest groups.
transferbestpractice: The expansion of a climate house to other destinations
  requires careful adaptation to local conditions. This includes selecting
  suitable locations based on climatic diversity and tourist attractiveness,
  adapting content to local audiences and integrating partnerships with
  educational institutions and environmental organizations. Financial
  sustainability and local funding sources must be taken into account, as well
  as adapting the architecture to local building regulations and environmental
  requirements. Training for staff to understand local sensitivities, as well as
  an effective marketing strategy to promote environmental awareness, are also
  crucial. Continuous monitoring and adjustment ensure the long-term success of
  the climate house at new locations.

Climate change is the challenge of our time.

 Bremerhaven city recognized this early on and brought it into focus when renewing the city center.
The Climate House offers a journey around the world through a wide variety of geographical zones and tells stories about the local flora, fauna, climate, history, its people and, above all, about the climate. However, the Climate House offers more than just the exhibitions.
It is also involved in research on its eponymous topic, serves as an event location and has offers for educators, schools and kindergartens, as well as enough animals to be officially designated as a zoo. The climate house is also an extracurricular learning location for different age groups.

The main exhibition is “The Journey,” where visitors move around the world along the 8th degree of longitude. The journey takes you through Switzerland, Sardinia, Niger, Cameroon, Antarctica, Samoa, Alaska and the Marsh Island Langeneß and ends where it began: in Bremerhaven.

At each station, visitors learn interesting facts about the geography, culture, biosphere and climate of the place. Each area is air-conditioned and adjusted to the average temperatures of the countries represented. The wildlife ranges from tropical fish to monitor lizards. The experience center is part of the European Stud Book Program.
The culture is represented by locals from the different places, so visitors learn more about the culture and customs of these people.

The second exhibition is called “Perspectives”. Visitors can learn everything from the natural process of switching between warm and cold states in our climate to the effects of the man-made climate change we are currently experiencing in this exhibition area. Visitors can learn more about research on this topic using ice core samples, fossils and tree rings. Stations offer audio, video and even microscopes to see the change for yourself.

Construction of the next spectacular exhibition area has begun in the Klimahaus Bremerhaven. The focus of “weather extremes” is on the drastic changes as a result of climate change. The interactive exhibition spans three floors and will open in March 2024.
