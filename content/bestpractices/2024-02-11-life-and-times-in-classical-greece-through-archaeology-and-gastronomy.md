title: Life and Times in Classical Greece through Archaeology and Gastronomy
desc: A project developed and applied at the Archaeological Museum of Agios
  Kirykos presenting to young audiences some aspects of life and society in
  Classical Greece through an initiation to dietary and gastronomic traditions
  as revealed in some of the Museum's exhibits. Links and distinctions are drawn
  between such dietary and gastronomic aspects of Ancient Greece and their
  present-day equivalents regarding foodstuffs, utensils and communal practices.
  It is addressed to both the tourist groups' younger members as an added
  in-destination attraction, as well as to the students of local schools
  contributing, among others, to their future ability to act as informed hosts.

locationbestpractice: Ikaria island, North Aegean region, Greee
timebestpractice: Three hours per one day session, available according to demand.
resourcesbestpractice: "Total cost: €1100 – of which Round table: €200,
  Production of ceramics and clay copies: €550, Production of clay items by
  visitors: €50, Animator fees (per three-hour session): €300"
successbestpractice: Feedback from participants was obtained through a
  questionnaire completed at the end of sessions. The project received almost
  unanimous support, with participants revisiting the museum on their own,
  having gained a much deeper awareness of the meaning of its contents.
  Accompanying adults and teachers (in the case of school parties) expressed
  highly positive comments as to the young participants’ reaction to the whole
  event and experience.
challengesbestpractice: Relations between the project organiser and animator on
  one side and the museum and archaeological authorities on the other were
  occasionally uneasy, as the latter were often reluctant to provide the former
  the necessary permissions to operate within the museum. Moreover, holding the
  project while the museum is open and full of visitors, can perturb the smooth
  running of the activity.
transferbestpractice: The project can be easily transferred as its initiator and
  animator at the Archaeological Museum of Agios Kirykos has produced a detailed
  description of the activities to be developed in every step of its
  materialisation. In addition, the method adopted could be applied to museum
  and exhibitions with very different thematic content to that of archaeological
  museums. Showcase exhibits are the core of all such institutions, clay
  replicas of which can be easily produced and used as props for participative
  game activities by young visitors, and as the subject of explanatory
  narratives presented by the animator regarding some aspects of the life and
  times the museum / exhibition is meant to display. The same method has already
  been applied by the animator in a project at the Archaeological Museum of
  Kerameikos, in Athens, informing and explaining on the burial rites of
  Classical Greece.

In the project 'Tonight We Are Having A Banquet', young audiences, both among visitors during the tourist season and school children during the school year, follow a two and a half hour session enabling them to   get to know a little better the ancient Greek culture and everyday life, to come directly to the exhibits, and to realise that, even if we are separated by thousands of years from the ancient Greek society and culture, there are some things that have not changed over the centuries. In addition, during the educational programme, children will learn how to observe, categorise, search and identify the objects in the display cases and therefore relate the ancient tools with their modern equivalents.
