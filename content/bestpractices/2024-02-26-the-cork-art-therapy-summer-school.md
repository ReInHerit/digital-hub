transferbestpractice: The delivery model Art Therapy Summer School is easily
  transferable to any third level or further education institution, particular
  those with an established record in delivering art, design, cultural or
  tourism programmes – either on a full-time or part-time basis. Visiting art
  therapists, from Ireland and further afield, facilitate an immersive
  experience of the Art Therapy process in the Cork school; this pool of
  expertise can be drawn upon from any number of European and locations … even
  offering the potential for staff or student exchange in the future. In a world
  of new technologies, it is also possible to offer the learner a blended
  learning experience, tapping into the Cork expertise while drawing on local or
  regional resources in new locations. A pedagogy partner could also prove
  helpful in supporting the development and initial delivery of the programme
  and an artist-in-resident could be considered a valuable addition or unique
  selling point for a new programme.

Art Therapy - as a response to a need for a deeper register of expression – fuses aspects of the disciplines of Modern Art, Outsider Art and Art Education together with Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy to provide practical mental and physical health benefits for practitioners. Art Therapy was a largely underappreciated concept and so the Crawford College of Art and Design was particularly well-placed to respond to this gap in the market. The annual Cork Art Therapy Summer School welcomes those with an interest in the therapeutic potential of art to Ireland’s second city, providing them with a unique opportunity to learn about and immerse themselves in the Art Therapy process in the conducive setting offered by a designated UNESCO City of Learning and World Health Organisation Healthy City. Over the course of a week, a series of related lectures, seminars and experiential workshops, facilitated by visiting art therapists, from Ireland and further afield, provide a context for the current practice of art therapy through engaging with and developing a personal understanding of the creative processes – through reflective learning – in a series of studio based workshops. For some this summer school may be the first step on the road to a career in Art Therapy supports and services. For others, it may be an opportunity to re-engage with their creative identity. For trainee and qualified therapists, it may provide continuing professional development.
