resourcesbestpractice: "A group of committed center workers who aim to bring art
  and culture closer to people in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, as

  that can be adapted for visits by people with Alzheimer’s.  "
successbestpractice: "The Alzheimer's Programme has been active since its
  creation by CCCB staff members in October 2010. Evaluation numbers show it has
  become the leading cultural programme aimed at people with Alzheimer's in
  Spain, being the primary referent for other cultural platforms such as the
  History Museum of Barcelona and the Contemporary Art Museum of Alicante which
  are currently working on adapting their programming to the elderly and to
  people with cognitive disabilities. The Alzheimer's programme has also become
  a role model for adapted visits at the Olympic Museum and the Museum of
  Performing Arts of Barcelona (MAE). Moreover, there is General Report and an
  Evaluation Report (conducted by Vic University) of the programme proving that
  over the more than ten years the programme has been running, it has been shown
  to have a positive impact on both the cognitive and emotional well-being not
  only of participants but also on their caregivers, their family members and on
  cultural educators. Firstly because the Alzheimer's Programme breaks with the
  exclusion and isolation of Alzheimer's patients, as the Evaluation and
  Assessment Report shows. Secondly, because adapted programming proves that
  providing Alzheimer's patients with workshops and physical-visual stimuli
  engages them with the moment, setting aside the myth that Alzheimer's patients
  live in the past. Moreover, because providing Alzheimer's patients with
  learning experiences proves to slow the impact of their disease if in the
  early stages of the disease. Success data include: -More than 100 visits part
  of the Alzheimer's programme -More than 1,300 annual regular users from 30
  Associations and Day Centers -Becoming the elderly and adapting programming
  role model of the association Apropa Cultura (a Catalan network of cultural
  institutions focussed on making culture accessible) since 2013 -Member of the
  Museums and Accessibility Working Group since 2013."
challengesbestpractice: "Staff Training: Museum staff need to be adequately
  trained to effectively interact and communicate with individuals with
  Alzheimer’s and their caregivers. Exhibition Adaptation: Exhibitions need to
  be adapted to be accessible and engaging for individuals with Alzheimer’s,
  which may require changes in exhibition presentation and design. Impact
  Evaluation: Measuring the cognitive and emotional impact of these programs can
  be challenging as it requires long-term data collection and analysis.
  Alternative Activities: Creating alternative activities, such as film programs
  or history sessions, requires additional planning and coordination. Demand:
  Organizing activities “on demand” can be logistically challenging and require
  flexible management."
transferbestpractice: Institutions might find it difficult to adapt current
  programming to Alzheimer-patients-focused activities. However, cultural
  institutions can apply museum programming for vulnerable audiences to a
  specific audience, from the elderly and people with disabilities related to
  mobility or cognitive diversity to Alzheimer patients. It is not a matter of
  adapting all programming but, rather, a matter of putting the effort into
  making the programming more accessible and open up to systematically excluded
  audiences. In connection to Alzheimer's programming, transfer potential comes
  from having specialized staff that might better understand and suggest how
  specific activities can be profitable and beneficial for Alzheimer patients.
  On the other hand, having a network of cultural institutions focussed on
  programmes for people with disabilities and the elderly is a good way of
  starting adapted programming.
infosbestpractice: "Complementary Activities: A set of activities that can be
  organized in addition to exhibition visits. These could include cinema
  sessions, history sessions based on photographs, or short tours to get to know
  the surroundings of the museum.  Education Service: An education service that
  can organize and coordinate the activities. This service would also be the
  point of contact for more information about the activities.  Network of
  Institutions: Contact with other institutions that offer cultural activities
  for people affected by Alzheimer’s. This would allow for resource and
  experience sharing.  Collaboration with Local Entities: Working with local
  entities, such as the Diputació de Barcelona, to encourage and assist other
  cultural centers in implementing similar activities.  Impact Assessment: A
  method for assessing the cognitive and emotional impact of the activities on
  participants, caregivers, family members, educators, and the institution
  itself. The Alzheimer's Programme has become the leading cultural programme
  aimed at people with Alzheimer's in Spain. CCCB is currently working alongside
  Barcelona's County Council to expand the existing network of institutions in
  Barcelona that offer cultural activities for people affected by Alzheimer's,
  encouraging and helping other cultural centres to implement activities along
  these lines."

The CCCB’s Alzheimer Programme was created in October 2010 by a group of workers from the Centre with the aim of bringing art and culture closer to people suffering the initial stages of the disease, as well as for their carers and family members. It offers adapted visits to the CCCB’s exhibitions and organises a complementary set of activities.

Over the course of the ten years that the programme has been running, it has been shown to have made a positive impact on both the cognitive and emotional wellbeing of participants and on carers, family members, educators and the institution itself.

The programme’s offering is based on making visits adapted to the exhibitions. When a visit to an exhibition is not possible for any reason, we offer alternative activities: a cinema session at our auditorium with a selection of classical fragments of international and Spanish musical cinema or a full movie screening, a session on the history of the Casa de Caritat based on photographs by Brangulí or alternatively a short itinerary to get to know the CCCB’s surroundings. The activities are offered on demand and take place on Mondays. For more information, please contact the Education Service (seducatiu@cccb.org).
