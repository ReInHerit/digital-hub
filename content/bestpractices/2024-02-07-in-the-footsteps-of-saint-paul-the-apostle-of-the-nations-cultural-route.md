  integrate UNESCO World Heritage Sites, St Paul churches and festivals in
  Pafos, Cyprus, Central Macedonia, Greece and Lazio Region, Italy. All of the

  cooperation between museums and heritage sites. Digitalisation of the route
  and the local trails in needed to facilitate access and awareness-raising of
  both visitors and residents.
transferbestpractice: "Cultural Routes offer a very good basis for effective
  cooperation between museums and heritage sites. By creating and supporting
  cultural routes programmes, such as the Cultural Routes of the Council of
  Europe, there are achievements of promoting, preserving and understanding
  history of different regions and countries through inter-regional exchange of
  people, ideas and cultures. Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe have been
  established since 1987, stressing the importance of European identities. The
  Enlarged Partial Agreement (EPA) currently comprises 45 routes contributing to
  protection and development of natural and cultural heritage. Cultural Routes
  are used as powerful tools to promote and preserve EU’s shared and diverse
  cultural identities. Cultural Routes provide a better understanding of the
  history of Europe through interregional exchanges of people, ideas and
  cultures. They are a model for grassroots cultural co-operation, providing
  important lessons about identity and citizenship. Cultural Routes combine
  tangible and intangible heritage, illustrating and celebrating the exchanges,
  cultures and traditions that have shaped Europe over the millennia. Cultural
  Routes are instrumental in the European context, by promoting common European
  identity, deploying heritage and traversing borders for cultural tourism. In a
  very recent development (November 2021) the United Nations World Tourism
  Organization (UNWTO) and the Council of Europe work together to develop the
  opportunities tourism offers to local communities and to enhance the tourist
  experience along the European region’s Cultural Routes. The joint actions are
  aimed at recognizing the added value that Cultural Routes offer for
  sustainable tourism development, cultural heritage safeguarding and
  intercultural dialogue. The collaboration also further highlights the Cultural
  Routes’ potential for advancing social, economic and cultural development,
  benefitting both Europe and its partner countries by strengthening cultural
  and historical ties. "

The St Paul's footsteps Cultural Route concept is based on similar religious and pilgrimage [Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/cultural-routes), closely examined by the founding partners in the [Cult-RInG Interreg Europe](https://projects2014-2020.interregeurope.eu/cult-ring/) project during January 2017 - March 2021, such as the [Santiago de Compostela Pilgrim Routes](https://www.coe.int/en/web/cultural-routes/the-santiago-de-compostela-pilgrim-routes) in North Portugal, [Route of Saint Olav Ways](https://www.coe.int/en/web/cultural-routes/the-route-of-saint-olav-ways) in West Sweden, [Via Francigena i](https://www.coe.int/en/web/cultural-routes/the-via-francigena)n Lazio Region. The preaching and legacy of St Paul has been very well researched and documented by several scholars, but not in terms of a comprehensive European Cultural Route. This has been done for the first time by the [EGTC](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/home/egtc.html) founding partners and their stakeholders, including relevant academics and experts, through several meetings, workshops, discussions and study visits at main sites.

Parts of the Cultural Route had been operating in terms of contemporary [travelling](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/travelling/) and [cultural tourism](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/about/cultural-tourism.html) for several years, i.e. in [Pafos](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/travelling/cyprus/paphos-cyprus.html), Cyprus since 2006, ['Cammino di San Paolo](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/travelling/italy/lazio-rome.html)[/Via Appia Antica'](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/travelling/italy/via-appia.html) in [Lazio](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/travelling/italy/) Region, Italy, relevant sites in Amphipolis, Apollonia, Nea Fokea, Sithonia, Thessaloniki and Veria, in Central Macedonia Region, Greece. The Cultural Route brings together and integrates all these previous highly relevant initiatives in promoting [cultural heritage](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/about/heritage.html) and [European values](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/about/european-values.html), by sustainable [cultural tourism](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/about/cultural-tourism.html)[](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/about/cultural-tourism.html), pilgrimage and [walking tourism ](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/about/walking-tourism.html)activities. Further developments continue.

The [Region of Central Macedonia](https://www.pkm.gov.gr/) from Greece, the [Lazio Region](https://www.visitlazio.com/en/) from Italy, the [Pafos Regional Board of Tourism](http://visitpafos.org.cy/) from Cyprus, and the [European Cultural Tourism Network](http://culturaltourism-network.eu/) based in Brussels, Belgium, have agreed to form a [European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC)](https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/policy/cooperation/european-territorial/egtc/) that develops, implements, manages, promotes and supports the European Cultural Route: "In the footsteps of St Paul, the Apostle of the nations", as a result of the [Cult-RInG Interreg Europe project](http://interregeurope.eu/cult-ring) (Cultural Routes as Investments for Growth and Jobs, 2017-2021). The above founding members of this EGTC have signed a [Memorandum of Understanding and Cooperation](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/onewebmedia/MoU%20signed.pdf) in which they have agreed to jointly develop, implement, manage, promote and support the above transnational cultural route for ultimate certification by the [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/cultural-routes).

###### [Aim of the Cultural Route](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/about/#E1FBB210-B30B-4836-AECE-0E9FAD765FF3)

* To highlight the rich [cultural heritage](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/about/heritage.html) aspects and [legacy](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/legacy/) of Saint Paul’s [missions](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/journeys/) to the gentiles and the forming of Christianity in Europe; also through his [epistles ](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/legacy/epistles.html)and intangible heritage in literature, fine arts, history, philosophy and theology.
* To link up sites and trails of [Saint Paul's missions to Europe](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/journeys/), in promoting [European values,](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/about/european-values.html) human rights, liberty, democracy and the rule of law.
* To develop and promote sustainable [cultural tourism ](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/about/cultural-tourism.html)at the points of interest, pilgrimage and [walking tourism](https://www.stpaul-culturalroute.eu/about/walking-tourism.html) along the Cultural Route.

The legacy of Saint Paul, the Apostle of the nations, is an excellent and fundamental representative theme of European ideals closely and uniquely related to the principal values of the Council of Europe.

In both the Acts and Apostle Paul’s 14 epistles there are several references of wise and divine preaching about freedom, equality, dignity, human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
