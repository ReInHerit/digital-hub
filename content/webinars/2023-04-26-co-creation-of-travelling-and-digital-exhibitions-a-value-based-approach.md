### About this webinar:

What is the value of co-creative processes in the museum sector? How can museum-adequate exhibitions be created across locations and themes without the need to move original objects? What opportunities are opened up for museums through cooperation and engagement with different institutions?\
Sibylle Dienesch, Director and Curator at the Graz Museum, and Catalin Betz, Curatorial Assistant and Curator, will address these and other questions in a 60-minute webinar. The questions will be explained and presented on the basis of the project exhibitions created as part of the ReInHerit project, the[ Digital Exhibitions](https://reinherit-hub.eu/exhibitions) and the [Digital Collection](https://collection.reinherit-hub.eu).
