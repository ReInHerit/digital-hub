### About this webinar:

This webinar gives an overview of low-threshold technologies for creating 3D models with photogrammetry. Photogrammetry is a technology that uses photos of objects to convert them into a digital 3D model with the help of specialized software tools. In recent years, the technology has become increasingly easy to access and use even for people who do not have a background in imaging technology. It holds potential for museums and Cultural Heritage institutions who are interested in exploring new ways of digitizing, preserving, exploring and exhibiting Cultural Heritage objects while working with a limited budget. The webinar discusses the basic photogrammetry process by showing hands-on example cases. It will focus on the technical requirements and challenges in creating 3D models with photogrammetry, with a special focus on potential issues in working with Cultural heritage objects. After the webinar, participants will have a basic understanding of the photogrammetry process, will be familiar with potential challenges and issues in digitizing objects with photogrammetry and will have the foundational knowledge to test out photogrammetry themselves.
