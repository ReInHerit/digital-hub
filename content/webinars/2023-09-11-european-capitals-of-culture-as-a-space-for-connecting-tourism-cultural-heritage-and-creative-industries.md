### About this webinar:

The title of European Capital of Culture has become, in the last decade, a unique opportunity for small and medium size cities to valorise their cultural activities, their cultural heritage and local creative scenes by also boosting tourism, placing them on the European map of destinations. 

More and more, over the years, the cities bidding for the title are reflecting not only on their cultural strategies and offers but also how new forms of tourism could be linked to them to be more sustainable, respectful of the local heritage and local communities, allowing the visitors to fully experience local life and locals not to suffer gentrification processes and huge changes in their daily habits. 

The role of creative industries as promoter of innovation, fully in line with the concepts of the New European Bauhaus, has become more and more central in the bid books of the candidate cities and in the final programs of the selected one.

The webinar will explore these connections and dimensions by comparing the experiences of three European Capitals of Culture from the past (Kosice 2013), the present (Matera 2019) and the future (Chemnitz 2025) all of them with important experiences in connecting tourism, cultural heritage and creative industries and potential examples for future cities.
