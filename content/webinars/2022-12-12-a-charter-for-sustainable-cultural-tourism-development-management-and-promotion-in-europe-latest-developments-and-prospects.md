### About this webinar:

The Webinar will present and discuss the ‘[ECTN](https://www.culturaltourism-network.eu) Charter for Sustainable Cultural Tourism’, a statement of principles on policies and strategies guiding the development, planning, management, operations and promotion of cultural and heritage tourism in the EU and beyond, for the benefit of tourist destinations, host communities, cultural heritage bodies, businesses and visitors. The purpose of this Charter is to bring together in a single, comprehensive and integrated document the main principles, features, findings, initiatives, conclusions and recommendations, regarding the development, management and promotion of cultural heritage tourism. The overall aim is to encourage sustainable and responsible tourism policies and actions across Europe and beyond, through engaging culture and heritage with innovation and cohesion. The Charter was first launched in 2014 and has been revised as the ECTN contribution for the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018. There is a major revision planned with several enhancements, starting in 2023 to be concluded in 2024 (10 years anniversary). This Webinar will include an introduction to cultural heritage tourism principles and practice, as well as latest relevant latest developments, such as the ‘ICOMOS International Charter for Cultural Heritage Tourism: Reinforcing cultural heritage protection and community resilience through responsible and sustainable tourism management’ and the EU ‘Transition Pathway for Tourism’.
