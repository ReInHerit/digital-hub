### About this webinar:

This webinar aims at presenting the main strategy for inclusion and accessibility to museum collections for the hearing and visually impaired. Following the museum’s participation in European research programmes and the close collaboration of the department of Educational and Community programmes with associations of people with hearing and visual impairments, the museum has designed and implemented an inclusive strategy which is dynamic and constantly updated to cater to new research and audience needs. The webinar focuses on the case study of the programme “In touch with the Cycladic Civilisation” with examples of inclusive strategies, the development of a mobile showcase for a tactile experience of museum exhibits for the visually impaired as well as sign language use in the museum context
