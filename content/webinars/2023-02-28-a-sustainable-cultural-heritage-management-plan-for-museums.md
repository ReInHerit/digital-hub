### About this webinar:

Cultural Heritage Management is the main vehicle for helping museums to face challenges, secure sustainable competitiveness, be resilient to climate change, natural hazards and pandemic risks, and redefine themselves in a constantly changing world. This webinar contributes to the understanding of how to establish a state-of-the-art management plan for museums, which takes into account the latest developments in the field. It aims to offer clear and concise information on the cultural heritage sector needs, challenges, bottlenecks and opportunities, and bring forward the main issues and principles that need to be taken into account during the drafting procedure of a Cultural Heritage Management plan.Â
