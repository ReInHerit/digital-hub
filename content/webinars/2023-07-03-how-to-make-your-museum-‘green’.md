### About this webinar:

The aim of this webinar is to highlight the need for the cultural heritage sector to deal with important issues that are related to climate and environmental concerns. The speakers will present innovative sustainability and climate action practices that can be integrated into various aspects of museums, other cultural institutions and sites sustainability planning. The discussion examines and tries to explain the concept of ‘energy efficient’, ‘sustainable’ or ‘green’ museums. The aim is to assist professionals in the challenge they face in their climate action. Adapting a Green strategy will strengthen the quality of the environmental assessment procedure, align that procedure with the principles of smart regulation, and enhance coherence and synergies with EU legislation and policies.
