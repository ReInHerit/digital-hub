### About this webinar:

The webinar discuss ideas explored in the latest event created as a case study within the framework of ReInHerit: the immersive performance at the Mansion of Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios. This interdisciplinary performance required the collaboration of a diverse group of professionals and invited the audience to take initiative in shaping their experience of visiting the museum. The webinar will present ideas and lessons learned related to the following areas and how these can contribute to the creation and development of similar future initiatives in cultural heritage sites:

* combination of sound-installations with live music performers
* 3D scanning and printing of objects for a multisensory exhibition
* touch-reactive replicas of exhibits not accessible to the public
* remotely controlled movement-triggered sound installations
* site-specific lighting and video art design and projection
* pre-show dissemination strategies on social media
