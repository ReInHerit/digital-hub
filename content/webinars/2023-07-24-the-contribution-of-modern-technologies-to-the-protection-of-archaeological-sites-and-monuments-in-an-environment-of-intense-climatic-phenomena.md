### About this webinar:

In recent years, a new round of technological revolution led by digital technologies such as robotics, big data, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, reverse engineering with 3D printing and scanning, virtual and augmented reality, are creating significant changes both in everyday life and in production and processing methods. These changes have huge implications for the global economy, industry and wider society as a whole.

They could not leave the world of culture untouched. Their contribution to the protection of archaeological sites and monuments in an environment of intense climatic phenomena is very important and is rapidly evolving through the application of technological achievements. By presenting the scope of these technologies and focusing on their application in the protection of archaeological sites and monuments, the need for interconnection and integration of new technologies with archaeological sites and monuments is highlighted.

Following the role of these emerging technologies, a novel practical approach will be presented that consists of risk assessment techniques and edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things. The practical, holistic and easily adaptable methodology will reveal how intelligent agent technology can have a significant impact, improving the way in which first responders and monument managers, even visitors, react to and handle risky or emergency situations. A pilot case study will emphasize how monuments and human lives can be protected and saved. The aim is to understand how right prognosis along with smart decisions will help prevent potential damage to the Cultural and Natural heritage without human losses.
