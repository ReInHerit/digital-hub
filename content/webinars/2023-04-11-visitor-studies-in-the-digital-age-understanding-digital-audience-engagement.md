### About this webinar:

This webinar will consider methods and possibilities for digital audiences research and digital engagement evaluation. In a period in which museums are increasingly adopting digital tools for mediating and communicating with their audiences, aiming to foster participation and reach a broader set of publics, it is becoming increasingly important to also develop clearer evaluation methods for analysing the impact of these digital initiatives. Although digital audience research has a longer history, during the last decade – and in particular in the recent COVID-19 years – the need for clear workflows, benchmarks, and data practices to gather and analyse the experiences of online visitors and users of our digital applications has become a priority for the sector.

This webinar will briefly introduce the context in which these studies have been developed and, subsequently, focus on qualitative and quantitative methods for researching digital audiences and analysing digital engagement.
