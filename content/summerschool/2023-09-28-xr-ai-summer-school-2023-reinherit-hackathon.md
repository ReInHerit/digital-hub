Students and researchers from **different international academic backgrounds** participated in the international [XR&AI Summer School](https://xrsalento.it/xrai-summer-school-2023/) 2023 from 17 to 22 July in Matera Italy, working on the topics of **Extended Reality** and **Artificial Intelligence**. The school was held in the [House of Technology](https://ctematera.it) in Matera and was organized with the support of [**MateraHUB**.](https://www.materahub.com)

In the context of the School, a **creative hackathon** was organised where young PhD students worked in an **interdisciplinary** way on web apps re-using open-source codes shared in the ReInherit Digital Hub.  In collaboration with particular multidisciplinary experts, apps from the **Reinherit Toolkit were tested and redesigned,** working on the codes, user experience, graphical user interface and application scenarios in museum contexts.

In addition to these workshop activities, **international** **speakers** and **famous experts** debated and engaged with students and researchers with different educational content and skills, and from different international countries: the United Arab Emirates to Saudi Arabia, from Sweden to the Netherlands, from Spain to Italy. The heterogeneous training of the participants covers different disciplines such as Robotics, Serious Games, Artificial Intelligence and Extended Reality, Digital Humanities, Interaction Design and Museum and Cultural Heritage Studies.  They lectured on different topics and applications of AI/XR in different contexts including museums and cultural heritage.

**Marco Bertini** and **Paolo Mazzanti** from [MICC ](http://www.micc.unifi.it)- University of Florence presented a practical lecture on '***Innovative and sustainable approaches for user engagement and digital interaction with cultural heritage'*.** Adopting a sustainable and user-centred approach, the aim was to share relevant results of the playful approach and user engagement studies conducted within the **ReInHerit H2020 research project**. Cutting-edge applications based on artificial intelligence developed by the Media Integration and Communication Centre were presented to inspire the students' project proposals. Important **local museums** were visited to test the apps in these contexts. **Experts** in the development of **AI-based applications in museums**were invited to **coach** the work of the participants and participate in **interviews** and talks in the presence of the **local community** and cultural **stakeholders**.
