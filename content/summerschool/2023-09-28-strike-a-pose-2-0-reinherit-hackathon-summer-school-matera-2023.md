## Description:

This co-creation process added new technological developments for apps and user interaction scenarios, improving engagement, inclusivity and new design features The project proposal, entitled Strike-a-Pose 2.0, aims to increase gamification by guiding users in interacting with museum artefacts, recreating the poses of characters from famous paintings. Starting from the existing applications of the ReInherit Toolkit, the team focused on providing more instructions to the user in interacting with the application, improving the codes and design. The project has the purpose of Increasing entertainment, promoting edutainment and stimulating young people to visit museums. 

During the hackathon, professionals and experts were invited [to chat  via  the Digital Hub Forum](https://reinherit.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/395690-XR.26AI-Summer-School-2023) to support students as they work, answering questions and sharing ideas and suggestions in a co-creative and interdisciplinary approach.
