### Team:

A multidisciplinary group of young PhD students worked on the theme *"Smart Interaction and Digital Content*", testing the Viola Chatbot and SmartLens apps, using open-source codes from Digital Hub and adapted them to artworks from some local museums. This co-creation process has revealed new potential technological developments for the ReinHerit apps and new user interaction scenarios.

### Description:

This co-creation process added new technological developments for apps and user interaction scenarios, improving engagement, inclusivity and new design features The project proposal, entitled AIFOCUS, aims to merge the chatbot 'VIOLA' and Smart Lens to create an interactive art experience, offering insights into works of art through conversation. Users explore works of art through the camera of their smartphone, engaging in discovering details through the enjoyment of multimedia content. The aim is to promote knowledge among young people and stimulate their curiosity about art, making learning an engaging and accessible experience for all. Users can scan the details to be examined with their smartphone camera. When users open the web app, they can explore and discover the details of the artwork.  They can start a conversation with the chatbot, which provides detailed answers about the analysed details. As a case study applied to the local context, the crib of the Matera Cathedral was chosen.

During the hackathon, professionals and experts were invited [to chat  via  the Digital Hub Forum](https://reinherit.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/395690-XR.26AI-Summer-School-2023) to support students as they work, answering questions and sharing ideas and suggestions in a co-creative and interdisciplinary approach.
