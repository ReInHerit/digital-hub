ReInHerit’s Travelling Exhibition architecture adapts to the specific conditions of each venue. It is modular, flexible in use and expandable. The spatial organisation depends on the dimension of the exhibition space, the number of exhibited Key Objects, the light situation and the situation of the entrance. In the present case it is a configuration for three Key Objects in a 40 m2 space. Each of the Key Objects defines a spatial footprint in the exhibition space consisting of a Projection, Bench and a Box, representing the Key Object. The design of the modular Boxes is related to the physical dimensions of digital Key Objects as core entities.
