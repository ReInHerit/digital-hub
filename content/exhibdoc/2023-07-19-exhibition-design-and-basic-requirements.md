ReInHerit’s Travelling Exhibition architecture adapts to the specific conditions of each venue. It
is modular, flexible in use and expandable. The spatial organisation depends on the dimension of
the exhibition space, the number of exhibited Key Objects, the light situation and the situation of
the entrance. In the present case it is a configuration for three Key Objects in a 40 m2 space. Each
of the Key Objects defines a spatial footprint in the exhibition space consisting of a Projection,
Bench and a Box, representing the Key Object. The design of the modular Boxes is related to the
physical dimensions of digital Key Objects as core entities.

EXACT DIMENSIONS


Elements of the Exhibition are distributed according to a hexagonal grid with a side length of 125
cm. The grid organizes the Elements (Projection, Bench, Box) and secures the distance between the
units.
