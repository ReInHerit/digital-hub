Once the fundamental questions about the aims of the Digital Exhibitions was determined, the development of the ReInHerit Digital Exhibitions moved into the wireframing stage. In this phase of the development, the ReInHerit Team designed the basic structural construction of the Digital Exhibitions. Questions surrounding basic page layouts, navigation structures and content placements were determined. A basic wireframe of the Digital Exhibition webpages was developed in a collaborative process, using the online platform Miro.
