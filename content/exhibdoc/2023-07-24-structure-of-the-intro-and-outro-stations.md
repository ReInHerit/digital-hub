The Intro station begins with a very brief teaser text explaining what the set of questions the visitor is about to be asked will explore. After that, visitors of the Digital Exhibitions are asked to select their current geographical location. This step is skipped in the on-site Intro, as the geographical location is preselected.

After this, the visitors answer the first three of four questions before they enter the exhibition. The questions are designed to inspire a philosophical exploration of one’s own position on aspects of the Thematic Areas. Since the visitors of the on-site exhibitions have the option of skipping the Intro and Outro, the option was also integrated into the Digital Exhibitions via a “Skip” button.

At the end of both the Travelling- and Digital Exhibition, the visitors answer a final question at the Outro station. Once they submit their answer to this final question, they are taken to a map overview where they can compare their answers to those of visitors from other parts of the world.
