### **Step 3:** Have a look at the **required technical media**.

Example for **one Station**:

<u>1 x Tablet</u>

\- at least 6GB of RAM and a good graphics solutions and processor to run the website or app smoothly.

\- Specific recommendations (two good options that meet the recommended specifications):

* the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE
* the Apple iPad Air (2020)

<u>1 x Projector</u>

 The projector should fit to the construction. Therefore, a small handy projector would be suitable.

Please mind the following technical **requirements for the projection**:

* Minimum Resolution: WXGA (1280x800)
* Projection Ratio: 0.8:1 – 1:1
* Minimum Ansi Lumens: 500
* Keystone Correction - Vertical: +/- 35° (minimum)

Specific recommendation:

* Optoma ML1050ST+

<u>Internet Connection</u>

A stable Internet connection is important to run the ReInHerit app, but also to show the INTRO and OUTRO stations in the beginning and the end of the exhibitions, which is an essential part of the concept.

<u>Electricity</u>

Since the objects are digital, it is unavoidable to have access to electricity. The amount of power sockets required depend on the scale of the exhibition.

<u>Cables</u>

The amount and the specifications of the cables are up to your implementation and the length depend on the size of your space.

Here is a showcase of cables we used in combination with the recommended projector “Optoma ML1050ST+” and the recommended tablet “Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE”.

The Intro and Outro Stations in the beginning and in the end of the exhibition also need electricity. The implementation depends on your equipment. Here are two options:

1. Tablet: open the respective link on the tablet and show it on full screen.
2. Touch Screen: Upload the link to a Raspberry Pi and connect it to the screen.
