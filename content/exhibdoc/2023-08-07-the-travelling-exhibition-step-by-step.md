### **1. Check out the existing ReThinking exhibitions...**

... at the Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens (Greece), at the Graz Museum in Graz (Austria) and at the Bank of Cyprus Cultural Foundation Nicosia (Cyprus):

### **2. General requirements: What do we need?**

* an around min. 50 to 70 m2 room
* a room that can be darkened
* some technical media like projectors and tablets (see step 2)
* Internet connection
* Electricity
* Some cables

### **3.** Have a look on the **required technical media**.

Example for **one Station**:

<u>1 x Tablet</u>

\- at least 6GB of RAM and a good graphics solutions and processor to run the website or app smoothly.

\- Specific recommendations (two good options that meet the recommended specifications):

* the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE
* the Apple iPad Air (2020)

<u>1 x Projector</u>

 The projector should fit to the construction. Therefore, a small handy projector would be suitable.

Please mind the following technical **requirements for the projection**:

* Minimum Resolution: WXGA (1280x800)
* Projection Ratio: 0.8:1 – 1:1
* Minimum Ansi Lumens: 500
* Keystone Correction - Vertical: +/- 35° (minimum)

Specific recommendation:

* Optoma ML1050ST+

<u>Internet Connection</u>

A stable Internet connection is important to run the ReInHerit app, but also to show the INTRO and OUTRO stations in the beginning and the end of the exhibitions, which is an essential part of the concept.

<u>Electricity</u>

Since the objects are digital, it is unavoidable to have access to electricity. The amount of power sockets required depend on the scale of the exhibition.

<u>Cables</u>

The amount and the specifications of the cables are up to your implementation and the length depend on the size of your space.

Here is a showcase of cables we used in combination with the recommended projector “Optoma ML1050ST+” and the recommended tablet “Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE”.

Cables for one station at the Graz Museum: 

![Cables for one station at the Graz Museum](https://ucarecdn.com/57605c94-6cce-44b9-93fc-f3fe70cf1228/-/crop/238x221/30,40/-/preview/)

* power cable extension to socket
* adapter plug to USB-Type-C / USB adapter
* 2 x USB Type-C to USB Type-C connection cable
* Samsung Multiport-Adapter (Ee-P3200) for HDMI output, Versatile USB A 3.1 connection, USB Type-C port for data exchange
* USB to USB connection cable
* 2 x HDMI to HDMI connection cable
* HDMI Adapter Coupling Connector, Standard HDMI Female Type A
* USB cable of the loudspeaker for data exchange
* stereo AUX cable of the loudspeaker for the connection to the projector
* power connection cable of the projector

The Intro and Outro Stations in the beginning and in the end of the exhibition also need electricity. The implementation depends on your equipment. Here are two options:

1. Tablet: open the respective link on the tablet and show it on full screen.
2. Touch Screen: Upload the link to a Raspberry Pi and connect it to the screen.

### **4﻿. Non technical requirements**

* **Exhibition furniture**: Find the technical drawings and all the requirements of the architecture at the [Exhibition Architecture Manual](https://reinherit-hub.eu/exhibdoc/docarchitecture/). 
* Fire proof [projection textile](https://reinherit-hub.eu/exhibdoc/docarchitecture/) 
* Telescopic rods, mount for the projector, frame for the textile
* The exhibititon needs a **darkened or dimmed room**: Have a look if the room is already dark enough, if not, try to take all possible arrangements to darken the room.
* The implementation of **analogue interactions**, which suit the topic of the exhibition, form a good contrast to the digital offer.

![Analogue Interaction](https://ucarecdn.com/639fb834-9dd3-4ffd-b2a8-e4dce9f3f703/)

* **Workshops** with different target groups raise new perspectives and make the topics more vivid and tangible.
* There is always an option to add **original objects** of your institution or a **reproduction**. It shows the advantages and differences between the representations. A reproduction, for example, can be touchable, the original cannot be replaced easily, therefore a very specific atmosphere emanates from it, and a digital representation can show details that would otherwise remain hidden to the spectator.

### 5﻿. Collect the required (technical) equipment...

... a﻿vailable in your institution or try to rent or buy the missing parts

### 6﻿. Download the App

* i﻿OS: <https://apps.apple.com/app/reinherit-3d-viewer/id6448781559>
* A﻿ndroid: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.reinherit.tablet>

O﻿r try the Web App first: <https://tablet.reinherit-hub.eu/>.

### 7﻿. Install the app...

.﻿.. on the tablets and follow the technical instructions [here](https://reinherit-hub.eu/exhibdoc/doctablet/). 

### 8﻿. Do you want to add content to the app?

![App](https://ucarecdn.com/65084deb-19e2-4c43-ad9c-98c747a96290/)

Please find the Google folder for your audio files and 3D models or images here:

<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gO1HGmg12iqlxrEAgJN3e8c3yg7xgQFg>

Here are the steps for adding the content:

* Copy the folder “\[TEMPLATE] Museums NAME” and rename it to your institutions name.
* Have a look on the folder “\[EXAMPLE] Graz Museum” to get a notion of the structure and the content.
* Prepare the content to your object/s for the app. This requires a 3D scan or a high quality photo of your object/s, texts to your object with different perspectives and audio files of these texts in your language and in best case in English and/or other languages.
* Open up your folder and start filling it with your content.

   \[01] GLTF or Display Image Files          

  \[02] Audio or Video Files

  \[03] Annotations
* Once all your data has been placed in the folders, our partner TRONIC Innovation GmbH will integrate it into the app. A few days later it can already be shown in the exhibition.
* Have a look on the “Technical Documentation and Requirements”-File in the folder to see how to install the app on your tablet later.

### 9﻿. Prepare the missing content

Object labels of your objects in the following order:

→ Artist/producer

→ Date

→ Material

→ Size

→ Place

In the [Exhibition Architecture Manual](https://reinherit-hub.eu/exhibdoc/docarchitecture/) you’ll find an example of the object label design.

All the content of the existing object labels are stored here:

<https://docs.google.com/document/d/14r1NOjqG1fXQmgF7yR_sYHS5-dGnXyhL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113649536349326826292&rtpof=true&sd=true>.

The exhibition texts can be taken over from the three museums or may be rewritten from your own institution with your own specifications. The text needs to be displayed somewhere in the beginning of the exhibition or right in front of it. You can choose the form of presentation of the exhibition text. In the three partner museums the texts were printed on the wall or on a textile, but you might also project it.

### 1﻿0. Install the INTRO and the OUTRO Station

The INTRO and OUTRO stations are the connection to the visitors. In the case of the ReThinking exhibitions, visitors are digitally addressed with three questions at the INTRO station and asked about their personal approach to the respective exhibition theme. This serves to introduce the visitors to the topic and to sensitize them. The OUTRO Station is on the one hand another digital user interaction, but it also provides insights into the answers of other visitors in other countries. Since the stations are also displayed in digital space, a connection between these two spaces is created. The more people participate in different places, the more interesting the response comparison becomes.

### 1﻿1. The Smart Lens

![Smart Lens ](https://ucarecdn.com/8602cf63-3dbb-4818-9830-b28a05a2a91c/)

The University of Florence and the MICC developed an app which can be used to get more ore detailed information about an object or specific parts of by using one’s own Smart Phone. It is a web app that does not require any download, but can be opened by scanning a QR code or by opening the link in a web browser.

![Smart Lens QR Code](https://ucarecdn.com/b6453864-c214-40a0-9e69-afa1e1178f40/)

The Smart Lens is an addition to the exhibitions. It allows the visitor to scan the object with its own smartphone. The Smart Lens highlights details of the object and provides additional information about it.
