As soon as the general concept of the Intro and Outro stations was determined, the ReInHerit Team began to explore possibilities for the content of the Intro- and Outro stations. In discussing different ideas, the concept of the “Philomat” came up as a potential tool to use in this context. 

The Philomat is a concept developed by the philosophers Hannes Rusch, Bettina Conradi and Wolfgang Buschlinger at the TU Braunschweig, Germany in 2007. The creators describe it as “an apparatus for ideological diagnostics.” It tells you how you think when you think. It asks you questions from everyday contexts and determines from your answers which philosophical convictions guide your thinking. The concept had been used by the ReInHerit Partner Graz Museum in one of their exhibitions before.

When the decision to use the Philomat was finalized, the ReInHerit Team got in touch with Wolfgang Buschlinger, who elaborated a set of four questions for each of the Thematic Areas of the ReThinking Exhibitions.
