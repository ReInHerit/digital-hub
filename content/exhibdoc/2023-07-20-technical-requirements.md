### Devices

As of April 2023, we recommend using a tablet with at least 6GB of RAM and a good graphics solutions and processor to run our website or app smoothly. These requirements are necessary due to the large amount of resources required by the website or app to display and process objects and annotations.

In terms of specific tablet recommendations, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE and the Apple iPad Air (2020) are both good options that meet the recommended specifications.

### Checklist

Fill out each field of the checklist provided in the Google Drive Folder. Ensure that you have provided all the necessary information to avoid delays in submitting your object for exhibition. Accuracy and completeness in the checklist will expedite the review and processing of your object.

### General

A working and stable Internet Connection is necessary, even when using the App or website.
