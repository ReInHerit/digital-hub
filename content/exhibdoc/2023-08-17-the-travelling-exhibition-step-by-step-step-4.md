### Sï»¿tep 4: Have a look at the non technical requirements

* **Exhibition furniture**: Find the technical drawings and all the requirements of the architecture at the [Exhibition Architecture Manual](https://reinherit-hub.eu/exhibdoc/docarchitecture/). 
* Fire proof [projection textile](https://reinherit-hub.eu/exhibdoc/docarchitecture/) 
* Telescopic rods, mount for the projector, frame for the textile
* The exhibititon needs a **darkened or dimmed room**: Have a look if the room is already dark enough, if not, try to take all possible arrangements to darken the room.
* The implementation of **analogue interactions**, which suit the topic of the exhibition, form a good contrast to the digital offer.

* **Workshops** with different target groups raise new perspectives and make the topics more vivid and tangible.
* There is always an option to add **original objects** of your institution or a **reproduction**. It shows the advantages and differences between the representations. A reproduction, for example, can be touchable, the original cannot be replaced easily, therefore a very specific atmosphere emanates from it, and a digital representation can show details that would otherwise remain hidden to the spectator.
