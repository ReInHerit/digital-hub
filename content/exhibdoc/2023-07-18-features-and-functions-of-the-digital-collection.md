The ReInHerit Digital Collection’s main page shows all the featured entries, represented by the submitted images for each object. The order of the objects randomly changes every time the page is reloaded. This ensures that all submitted objects get an equal level of exposure, and no one object is advantaged or disadvantaged in this regard by a fixed position in the displaying order. Moving the mouse over the image reveals a text box with the title of the object, as well as a short teaser text about the object’s background and a button linking to the respective object’s detail page. In the detail page, there is a longer text about the object, information about the object’s size, origin time, the artist or producer, the materials, as well as a link to the submitting institution’s website. For submissions that featured a 3D model, the object detail page features an embedded 3D viewer window from Sketchfab. The 3D viewer window is omitted when the submission only features a 2D image. In this case, a simple 2D viewer allows viewers to open the image in an overlay window, zoom in and rotate the image. This 2D viewer is featured for all entries. The bottom of the object detail page shows the Creative Commons license of the object, as well as the selected thematic area, the selected tags for the object and a link to the corresponding thematic area’s digital exhibition. The intention behind this is to generate more traffic to the digital exhibitions, as well as offering interested viewers more background on the thematic area. Clicking on each of the object’s tags also takes the visitors to a filtered view of the digital collection, which shows all entries with the same tag.

Back on the Digital Collection main page, in the top right, there are three main filtering options. The first filtering option is the filter for the Thematic Areas. Selecting one or more of the Thematic Area options filters the collection of entries submitted under the respective Thematic Area. Clicking on a filter option activates the filter, which is shown by the button turning from white to black, deactivating the filter works by clicking on the button again. The next filtering option filters for Categories. These categories correspond to the tags selected for the object in the submission process. There are currently thirty tag options, ten from each of the thematic areas. The Category filters work just like the Thematic Area filters and can be combined with each other and the Thematic Area filters, allowing for a large combination of filtering options. The final filtering option is the Locations filter. Clicking on the Locations filter takes the visitors to a map, which shows existing Digital Collection entries at their geographical location marked by coloured boxes. The colours correspond to the Thematic Areas to which the objects belong. The location information is taken from the submissions form, where the current location of the object is asked. In this map view, clicking on the boxes reveals a preview window of the object, featuring its title, the photo, the Thematic Area tag and the “see more” button, which links to the object detail page introduced above. The map view can be closed via a black X on the top right of the page.

Returning again to the main page, on the top right, there is a page menu indicated by three horizontal stripes in the yellow header bar. The page menu features links to the ReInHerit Digital Hub, an information page on the project, links to the three Travelling Exhibition partner museum websites, and most importantly, the “Contribute” page. On the Contribute page, there is a short text of the call for contributions to the Digital Collection, and a button at the bottom, which links to the Google Form for submissions. Finally, in the top bar, the words "ReInHerit" and "Exhibition" link to the Digital Hub homepage and the Digital Exhibitions overview page respectively.
