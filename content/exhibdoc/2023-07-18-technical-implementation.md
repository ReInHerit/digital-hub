2. **PHP**: PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is used extensively in WordPress development to handle server-side processing and dynamic content generation.

3. **JavaScript**: JavaScript is employed for client-side interactivity and enhancing the user experience on the website. 

4.  **jQuery**: jQuery, a popular JavaScript library, is utilized to simplify and streamline JavaScript coding and interactions.
