### 8﻿. Add own content to the App 

![App](https://ucarecdn.com/65084deb-19e2-4c43-ad9c-98c747a96290/)

Please find the Google folder for your audio files and 3D models or images here:

<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gO1HGmg12iqlxrEAgJN3e8c3yg7xgQFg>

Here are the steps for adding the content:

* Copy the folder “\[TEMPLATE] Museums NAME” and rename it to your institutions name.
* Have a look on the folder “\[EXAMPLE] Graz Museum” to get a notion of the structure and the content.
* Prepare the content to your object/s for the app. This requires a 3D scan or a high quality photo of your object/s, texts to your object with different perspectives and audio files of these texts in your language and in best case in English and/or other languages.
* Open up your folder and start filling it with your content.

   \[01] GLTF or Display Image Files          

  \[02] Audio or Video Files

  \[03] Annotations
* Once all your data has been placed in the folders, our partner TRONIC Innovation GmbH will integrate it into the app. A few days later it can already be shown in the exhibition.
* Have a look on the “Technical Documentation and Requirements”-File in the folder to see how to install the app on your tablet later.
