In the framework of the ReInHerit project, the three partner museums collaboratively developed three Digital Exhibitions in correspondence to the three Travelling Exhibitions “ReThinking Conflicts”, “ReThinking Craftsmanship” and “ReThinking Identities”. Developing digital formats poses potential challenges, especially for small to medium sized museums for a number of reasons. The following section will introduce and discuss some issues in digital format creation and some approaches to solutions elaborated through the ReInHerit Digital Exhibitions.
