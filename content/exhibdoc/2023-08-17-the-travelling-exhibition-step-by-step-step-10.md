### Step 1ï»¿0: Install the INTRO and the OUTRO Station

The INTRO and OUTRO stations are the connection to the visitors. In the case of the ReThinking exhibitions, visitors are digitally addressed with three questions at the INTRO station and asked about their personal approach to the respective exhibition theme. This serves to introduce the visitors to the topic and to sensitize them. The OUTRO Station is on the one hand another digital user interaction, but it also provides insights into the answers of other visitors in other countries. Since the stations are also displayed in digital space, a connection between these two spaces is created. The more people participate in different places, the more interesting the response comparison becomes.
