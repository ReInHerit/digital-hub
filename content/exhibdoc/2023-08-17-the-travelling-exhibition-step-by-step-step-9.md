### S﻿tep 9: Prepare your content

Object labels of your objects in the following order:

→ Artist/producer

→ Date

→ Material

→ Size

→ Place

In the [Exhibition Architecture Manual](https://reinherit-hub.eu/exhibdoc/docarchitecture/) you’ll find an example of the object label design.

All the content of the existing object labels are stored here:

The exhibition texts can be taken over from the three museums or may be rewritten from your own institution with your own specifications. The text needs to be displayed somewhere in the beginning of the exhibition or right in front of it. You can choose the form of presentation of the exhibition text. In the three partner museums the texts were printed on the wall or on a textile, but you might also project it.
