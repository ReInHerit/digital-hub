### About

When an exhibition is in progress, it is crucial that visitors using the tablet encounter a ready-to-use setup. This implies that the tablet should remain constantly active without enabling any screensaver, ensuring uninterrupted visibility and continuous operation of the designated app or website.

To achieve this, we recommend using a kiosk mode or similar feature that allows you to lock the tablet into a single app or website. This will prevent the user from accessing other apps or features on the tablet and help to ensure a smooth and distraction-free experience.

Kiosk mode, also known as "single-app mode" or "lockdown mode," is a feature that allows a device to run a specific application exclusively, restricting access to other apps or system functions. It is commonly used in public environments, self-service stations, or exhibition displays to provide a controlled and focused user experience.

In kiosk mode, the device is typically configured to launch a particular application automatically upon startup. Once in kiosk mode, the user cannot exit or switch to other apps or make changes to the system settings without appropriate authorization.

Kiosk mode works by disabling or hiding various device functionalities and options that are not relevant to the designated application. This may include disabling the home button, recent apps button, notifications, status bar, and preventing access to device settings. The intention is to create a dedicated and secure environment for users to interact with a specific application without distractions or unauthorized actions.

To exit kiosk mode, specific actions or authentication mechanisms (e.g., entering a PIN code or using a dedicated key combination) may be required to regain full access to the device's regular functionality.

It's important to note that the specific implementation and features of kiosk mode can vary depending on the operating system and device manufacturer.

### Recommended setup & security

Due to the wide variety of tablets available, frequent updates, and changes within operating systems, we cannot provide a specific and detailed list of instructions for setting up your tablet. What we can provide is a list of recommendations and security measures.

While not mandatory, it is highly recommended to take these precautions in case a visitor with malicious intent gains access to the tablet:

1. Delete all accounts and personal/company data stored on the tablet.
2. Remove any saved passwords from the tablet.
3. Set a PIN Code for your tablet

### Android Setup

***Remove Navigation Bar***

1. Access the Settings: Open the Settings app on your Android tablet. This is usually represented by a gear icon.
2. Navigate to Display Settings: In the Settings menu, locate and tap on the "Display" option. It is typically found under the "Device" or "Device Preferences" section.
3. Find Navigation Bar Settings: Scroll down the Display settings until you find the "Navigation bar" option. Tap on it to access the navigation bar settings.
4. Choose Swipe Gesture: Within the Navigation Bar settings, you will typically see options related to the navigation bar style, such as "Buttons" or "Swipe Gesture." Select the "Swipe Gesture" option to enable navigation gestures and hide the navigation bar.
5. Confirm and Apply Changes: Once you have selected the desired navigation bar style, the changes will be applied automatically. You will notice that the navigation bar is no longer visible, and you can navigate using gestures instead.

***Pin the App or Website***

1. Open the app or website you want to pin to the screen on your Android tablet.
2. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access the app overview or recent apps menu.
3. Locate the app or website you want to pin and swipe it upwards or tap on the "Pin" icon that appears on the app thumbnail. This will pin the app to the screen.
4. A confirmation message may appear asking if you want to pin the app. Tap on "OK" or "Pin" to proceed.
5. The pinned app or website will now be locked to the screen, and the tablet's navigation buttons will be disabled.
6. To unpin the app or website, press and hold the "Back" and "Overview" (or "Recents") buttons simultaneously for a few seconds until the screen unlocks. Note: The location of the navigation buttons may vary depending on your tablet's make and model. In some cases, you may need to swipe up from the bottom of the screen or swipe from the sides to access the navigation buttons.

Using the "Pin Window" feature allows you to keep a specific app or website open and prevent accidental navigation or switching to other apps. It's useful when you want to focus on a particular task or provide access to a specific content without distractions.

Please note that the exact menu names and options may vary slightly depending on the Android version and device manufacturer. It's always recommended to refer to the specific device's documentation or contact the manufacturer for precise instructions tailored to your tablet model.
