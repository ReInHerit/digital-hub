[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It allows you to build and train machine learning models for various tasks, such as image classification, natural language processing, and regression analysis.

TensorFlow can be used in mobile and web applications in a variety of ways. In the development of the ReInHerit toolkit we used it in two ways:

**Mobile applications**: TensorFlow provides several tools and libraries that can help you build machine learning models for mobile devices. For example, TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight version of TensorFlow designed for mobile and embedded devices. It allows you to run trained TensorFlow models on mobile devices with low computational resources. We used it in the **Smart Tourism app**.

**Web applications**: TensorFlow can be used to build machine learning models that run in the browser using JavaScript. TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to run TensorFlow models in the browser or in Node.js. We used it for **Face-fit, Strike-a-pose and Smart Lens apps**.
