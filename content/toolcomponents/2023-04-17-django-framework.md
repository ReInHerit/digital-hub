Django is a powerful and popular web application framework for Python that is designed to make web development easier, faster, and more secure.

Django provides a full-stack framework for building web applications, which means that it includes everything you need to build a complete and robust web application, from handling user requests to managing the database and rendering HTML templates.

Django has been used to develop the backend of several apps of the ReInHerit toolkit such as: **Multimedia Chatbot** and **Smart Video Restoration** demo app.
