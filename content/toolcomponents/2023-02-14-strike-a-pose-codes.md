The application has been developed in JavaScript on the client side and in Python on the server side. Pose detection on the human bodies is achieved using TensorflowJS 1 detection API exploiting the pose detection model, MoveNet. The model runs completely client-side in the browser. Server-side an SQLLite database is used to stores artworks’collections, challenges and artworks’ metadata and descriptions.

**Free Codes of the App are available here:**\
