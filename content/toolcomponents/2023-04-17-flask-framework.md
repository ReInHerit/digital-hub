Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-use web application framework for Python. Flask allows developers to quickly create web applications with minimal setup and boilerplate code. It provides a simple and flexible structure for building web applications that can be easily extended and customized.

With Flask, it is possible to easily define the routes for web application, handle user input and requests, and render HTML templates for displaying content to users. Flask also provides support for working with databases, managing user authentication and sessions, and integrating with other web technologies such as JavaScript and CSS.

Several backends of ReInHerit toolkit apps have been developed using Flask, such as **Strike-a-pose** and **Face-fit**.
