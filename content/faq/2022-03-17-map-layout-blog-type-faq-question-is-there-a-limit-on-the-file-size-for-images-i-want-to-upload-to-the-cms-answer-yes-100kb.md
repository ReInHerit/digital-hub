question: The image upload in the CMS didn't work, what went wrong?
answer: "Maybe your image is bigger than the set limit for image uploads, which
  is 100kb per image. If so you can either resize the image (a Manual on how to
  do so can be found under Manuals), or consider hosting the image yourself
  (e.g. via google drive) and link it to the hub. "
