ReInHerit is an Horizon 2020 project that aspires to disrupt the current status quo of communication, collaboration and innovation exchange between museums and cultural heritage sites, connecting professionals across           these fields, and supporting them in presenting Europe’s tangible and intangible heritage to citizens and tourists, in their wider historical and geographical contexts.

The ReInHerit project is proposing an innovative model of sustainable heritage management, through which a dynamic network will be born; this network comprised of cultural heritage professionals, innovation and cultural heritage solution tech experts, researchers, national museums, regional and local museums, and representative managers of Heritage Label sites.  

The Digital Hub fosters this network, hosting a series of resources (training resources and applications on conservation, digital engagement and youth participation, tourism) and aiming to become an ecosystem in which all stakeholders will be able to experiment with the resources and share their experiences.  

The project website describes in details the Work Packages and publishes the reports. Visit it at <https://www.reinherit.eu/>
